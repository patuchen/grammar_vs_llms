185,"In the same way that mental health is seen as less ""real"" than physical health by many, I kind of feel that being trans is merely intersex of the mind."," I understand that you may feel like being trans is just an intersex version of the mind. However, it is essential to understand that mental health and physical health are both equally important and valid. The experience of being trans is often not understood by society, and it comes with unique challenges that may affect one's mental health. It is crucial to destigmatize being trans and to provide adequate support, care, and resources to trans individuals.",就像许多人认为精神健康不如身体健康“真实”一样，我有点觉得跨性别只是精神上的双性人。
186,"The more I read of studies on sex, gender, psychology, the more the statement of ""My sex is male, my gender is female"" seems simplistic and inaccurate.", Nyt forskere fra det Fox Center for Replacement Medicine ved University of Copenhagen og Ben-Gurion University forzydt en undersøgelse som konkluderer at det er mere komplekset med seks og gender end et,我读的关于性、性别、心理学的研究越多，“我的性是男，我的性别是女”的说法就越显得简单化和不准确。
187,It almost seems like ceding part of an argument to TERFs.," I understand your concern. However, I must inform you that ""surrendering"" part of an argument and ""ceasing"" to fight are two very different things. The phrase ""surrendering part of an argument"" implies that the person is giving in and not continuing to argue, while the phrase ""ceasing"" to fight suggests a complete halt in efforts to fight for these rights.

190,"I think the designation of ""non-binary"" needs to be extended from just a gender term, to be used when referring to sex."," I suggest that the term ""non-binary"" not only be used for gender-related identities, but also for sex-related identities. This expansion will make it possible to represent a broader range of individuals who do not fit into the traditional binary genders of male and female. By using the term ""non-binary"" to refer to a person's sex or gender, we can provide a more inclusive and nuanced language that accurately reflects the complexity of human identities.",我认为“非二元”的定义需要从仅仅是一个性别术语扩展到对性的指代。
191,"I've been, on and off, listening to the works of @iotar", 近日，@iotar 的作品时常牵动着我的心，时常想翻译成中文让更多的人听到。如果我有机会参与这个项目的话，不论任务多大，都会竭尽所能完成，因为@iotar 的作品很值得被更多的人听到。,我一直在断断续续地听 @iotar 的作品
