0,The hacked up version of Jedi Knight was crashing because it was calling a function off the end of a vtable., The hacked up version of Jedi Knight was crashing because a function was being called off the end of a vtable.,绝地武士的破解版崩溃了，因为它调用了 vtable 结尾的一个函数。
1,"Turns out is was presuming that calling IDirect3D::CreateViewport() would return an IDirect3DViewport3, which has additional methods tacked onto the end compared to an IDirect3DViewport, which is what I've implemented.", 加上引用点。原来设想:调用IDirect3D::CreateViewport()会得到一个IDirect3DViewport3，这与IDirect3DViewport3相比，有额外的方法被绑定在一块，但实际上我已经实现了IDirect3DViewport3了。,原来是假设调用 IDirect3D::CreateViewport() 将返回 IDirect3DViewport3，与 IDirect3DViewport 相比，还有别的方法，这就是我实现的。
2,"To me, this is a pretty big assumption because it is only creating the viewport using a Direct3D object, not a Direct3D3 object."," As far as I can understand, the sentence ""this is a pretty big assumption because it is only creating the viewport using a Direct3D object, not a Direct3D3 object"" means that creating a viewport using a Direct3D object alone is a significant presumption, as the viewport should technically include a Direct3D3 object for proper functioning.",于我而言，这是一个非常大胆的假设，因为它仅使用 Direct3D 对象创建视口，而非使用 Direct3D3 对象。
3,"Now, I get that in practice, IDirectXObject2 is typically a proper superset of IDirectXObject, with no changed function signatures, and new methods only added to the end.", 翻译为中文。,现在，我明白了，在实践中，IDirectXObject2 通常作为 IDirectXObject 的一个适当的超集，不会改变函数签名，只是在末尾添加了新方法。
4,But this is not universally true; for those cases it matters what interface you are using to create the object in question.," The sentence ""Waht does thi English setnnec mean in Chinese?"" translates to ""\u606f\u529f\u660e\u5e74\u6765\u4e2d\u606f\u529f\u660e\u6709\u7ea7\ufeff\u4e86\u5973\u5ba9\u3002"" in Chinese. The meaning is ""What does this English vocabulary mean in Chinese?"". The additional sentence ""\u53d7\u707e\u3002 for those cases it matters what interface you are using to create the object in question"" can not be translated directly as it is a part of the original English text.",但这种方法并不是万能的；在这些情况下，使用什么接口来创建有问题的对象很重要。
5,"So anyway, since it does hold true here, to fix it I had to extend my viewport implementation to contain the IDirect3DViewport3 methods so that the call to the new one was valid."," Meaning: Since it does hold true here, to fix it I had to extend my viewport implementation to contain the IDirect3DViewport3 methods so that the call to the new one was valid.",无论怎样，由于它在此处确实成立，所以为了修复它，我必须扩展我的 viewport 实现来包含 IDirect3DViewport3 方法，从而使其对新方法的调用表现出有效性。
6,"Suppose for the sake of argument that science at least in part consists of lists of objectively factual statements about the world, true apart from any theory they might support."," This sentence means that science can be divided into objective facts and theories that explain these facts. True statements about the world can be presented as a set of mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive statements, which are not influenced by any specific theory.",以讨论为目的，假设科学至少存在一部分由关于世界的客观事实陈述的列表组成，除了其可能支持的任意理论之外，该等陈述皆为事实。
7,Even if it's true that such facts exist in science it's still possible to argue that scientific facts are theory-laden., 这句话的中文意思是:即使这样的事实在科学中存在即便是这样的事实存在于科学中这有可能是概念密集的。,即使这些事实确实存在于科学之中，仍然有可能认为科学事实是纯理论的。
8,Scientific facts result from experiments.," Certainly! It seems you asked about the meaning of ""Scientific facts result from experiments."" This sentence is written in English. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask!",科学事实源于实验。
9,"The experiments don't create the facts on this reading, but the choice of which experiments to conduct controls which facts are discovered."," The experiments do not create the facts in this reading, but the selection of which experiments to conduct controls which facts are discovered.",实验并不创造以上所述事实，但选择进行哪些实验控制了哪些事实会被发现。
10,"Some facts, e.g. about subatomic particles, can only result from experiments that are themselves only possible in capitalism because they require too much resources, too much organization, too much coercion, to pull off otherwise.", Translation provided:,一些事实，例如关于亚原子粒子的事实，只能从实验中得出，而这些实验本身只有在资本的支持下才有可能完成，因为它们需要付出大量资源、大量组织的参与、采取大量强制措施，否则就无法成功。
11,This is a very brief sketch of a plausible argument that theories of capitalism influencing the actual content of science are consistent with theories asserting the existence of objective scientific facts., 这句英语句子在中文是什么意思? 提到了资本主义的理论对科学的实质内容产生的影响，这与指出存在客观科学事实的理论并不矛盾。,以下是对一个似是而非的论点的简述，即资本主义影响科学实际内容的理论与断言客观科学事实存在的理论具有一致性。
12,"It's *not* an argument in favor of the existence of objective scientific facts, which I don't believe in."," In Chinese, the meaning of ""It's *not* an argument in favor of the existence of objective scientific facts, which I don't believe in"" is 不是争辩认同客观科学事实的存在的理由，我不相信他们的存在。",这 *并非* 一个支持客观科学事实存在的论点，我不相信这一论点。

25,And then we just... paid for our stuff., 中文逐字翻译:我们就…付了钱。,然后我们就...为我们买的商品结了账。

37,There is significant evidence that real-world communication cannot be reduced to sending signals with context-independent meaning., 翻译如下： 非常感谢您的帮助。 所说话的意思是：真实的沟通不可能简单化为由无背景的信息导读出来的表述。 英语十分感谢您的帮助。,大量证据表明，现实世界的通信不能简单认定为发送与背景毫无关联的信号。
38,"In this work, based on a variant of the classical Lewis (1969) signaling model, we explore the conditions for the emergence of context-dependent communication in a situated scenario.", 在这篇工作中，我们以罗伯特·刘易斯 (1969) 信号模型的变体为基础，探讨了在情景情境清楚？ 下生成有上下文依赖通信的条件。,在本研究中，我们以一个经典的刘易斯（1969）信号模型的变体为基础，对在一个情境场景中出现依赖背景的通信的条件进行了探索。
39,"In particular, we demonstrate that pressure to minimise the vocabulary size is sufficient for such emergence."," I can understand that this is a scientific paper that discusses the phenomenon of language evolution and the emergence of complex linguistic structures. It also emphasizes the importance of reducing vocabulary size for the efficient use of resources and communication in humans. However, without further context or explanation, I am unable to provide a detailed summary or analysis of the paper. Can you please provide me with more information or context about it?",特别地，我们通过证据证实，对于此现象的出现，最小化词汇量的压力就已足够。
40,"At the same time, we study the environmental conditions and cognitive capabilities that enable contextual disambiguation of symbol meanings."," As per the given sentence, ""contextual disambiguation of symbol meanings"" means the process of understanding the meaning of symbols in their context. Therefore, the sentence in English means that we study the environmental conditions and cognitive abilities that allow us to understand the meanings of symbols within their context.",与此同时，环境条件和认知能力在符号意义方面使语境出现歧义，我们对此进行了研究。
41,"We show that environmental constraints on the receiver's referent choice can be unilaterally exploited by the sender, without disambiguation capabilities on the receiver's end."," This is a meaningless sentence in Chinese. I'm not sure what language you meant to use. To translate it, ask the question in a more specific way.",我们发现，接收者选择所指对象的环境限制可以被发送者单方面利用，而接收者没有消除歧义的能力。
42,"Consistent with common assumptions, the sender's awareness of the context appears to be required for contextual communication."," Abiding by common assumptions, the sender's awareness of the context appears to be required for contextual communication.",与通常假设一致，发送者对语境的意识似乎是语境通信的必需条件。
43,"We suggest that context-dependent communication is a situated multilayered phenomenon, crucially influenced by environment properties such as distribution of contexts."," Within the field of human communication, a context-dependent view suggests that the intended meaning of a message can vary depending on the context in which it is said. In other words, the same message can have different meanings in different contexts. This view is based on the idea that language is not a discrete unit, but rather it is influenced by various social and environmental factors. These factors can include cultural norms, historical context, and individual preferences. Furthermore, context-dependent communication is often viewed as a multimodal phenomenon, meaning that it involves multiple channels of communication, such as verbal, nonverbal, and visual cues. The study of context-dependent communication also involves the analysis of the properties of communication environments, such as the distribution of contexts in a conversation or the variety of communication channels available. Ultimately, the aim of context-dependent communication is to ensure that communicators are able to successfully convey their intended message in a way that is clear and appropriate for their audience.",我们认为，依赖语境的通信是一种情景化的多层次现象，受到环境属性如语境分布的重要影响。
44,"The model developed in this work is a demonstration of how signals may be ambiguous out of context, but still allow for near-perfect communication accuracy.", 这句英语句子的中文意思是:该研究中开发的模型还显示:环境中不存在语义信号情况下，信号仍然可以实现接近完美的沟通准确度。,此研究中开发的模型表明，信号在脱离语境的情况下可能是模糊的，但仍然为几近完美的通信精度提供了条件。
