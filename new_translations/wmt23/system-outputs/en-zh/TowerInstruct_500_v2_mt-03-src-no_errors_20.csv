139,I gripe about dad-ification a lot., 不好意思，您好，我是一个机器翻译助理。 Please allow me to provide a Chinese translation for you.,我多父亲化这种行为非常抵制。
140,Here is a (slightly longer than) toot-length crash course in what I mean by dad-ification:," Dad-ification is the process of making everything in your life explicitly masculine for no good reason. It means spending lots of money on things you don't need, buying tools that you have no idea how to use, and wearing clothes that are too warm for the climate you live in. It's about taking on traits that are more commonly associated with men, even if you yourself do not identify as one. Dad-ification is a natural progression for many people when they hit middle age.",以下是关于我所说的“父亲化”的简单概述（略长）：
141,"It isn't my term, it is a term used to describe when a narrative or gameplay mechanic is built around a central protagonist (usually older, usually male) stewarding or guarding another person (often younger)."," The English sentence provided by the Chinese translation is incorrect. I have rephrased it with ""This phrase does not belong to me. It is a phrase used to describe a narrative or gameplay mechanism that revolves around an elderly male protagonist who is the guide or protector of another person, usually younger.""",这不是我自己创造的术语，这个术语用来描述叙事或游戏机制围绕一个中心主角（通常是年长的，通常是男性）管理或保护另一个人（通常是年轻的）。
142,The Last of Us is an easy and canonical example of dad-ification., Handle: The Last of Us is a canonical example of dadification. What I'm doing for the user: Analyzing the input text and providing them with the requested translation in English. Translation provided: The Last of Us is a canonical example of dadification. What I'm doing for the user: Reviewing the grammar and delivering a more sophisticated translation.,《最后生还者》是一个关于父亲化的经典示例。
143,"Joel uses his skills and ability to enact (extreme) acts of violence to accomplish a task that is coded as ""caring.""", Here’s the Chinese translation of the sentence: 琼用了他的技能和能力来实施（极端）的暴力行为，以完成一项被编码为“关怀”的任务。,Joel 利用其技能实施（极端）暴力行为，以完成一项代号为“关爱”的任务。
144,"Dad-ification usually posits that the solution to a situation where a parent figure must care for or protect a child or child stand-in is overwhelming strength, and using that strength to force a very specifically shaped power dynamic."," I don't have the information you asked for in my database. However, the passage you provided is about the concept of dad-ification, which assumes that a parent needs to possess overwhelming strength to properly take care of a child or someone who is substituting for a child. This concept also creates a power dynamic by using this strength to control the situation in a specific way.",父亲化一般意味着，在父母必须照顾或保护孩子或弱势人员时，这种方法就屡试不爽，他们使用这种方法强制将自己的这种特定权力凌驾于他人之上。
145,"Dad-ification erodes the possibility for communal solutions, and often wholly ignores, or undercuts any agency the child has."," The paternalization erodes the possibility for communal solutions, and often wholly ignores or undercuts any agency the child has.",父亲化不仅会削弱集体解决方案的可能性，还经常会完全忽视或削弱孩子的任何能动性。
146,"In this way, Dad-ification is a stand in for a lot of neoliberal ideals; especially ideas like bootstrapping and self-sufficiency as being an ultimate goal/indicator for success."," Da ein echter Vaterwert stehengeblieben und als Leitlinie für viel der neoliberalen Ideen galt; insbesondere solche, die dem Ankkergreifen oder der Selbstbestimmtheit den ultimativen Anspruch und Begleiterscheinung des Erfolgs geben.",这样看来，父亲化是许多新自由主义理想的代表；尤其是像自力更生和自给自足作为成功的最终目标/指标这样的想法。
