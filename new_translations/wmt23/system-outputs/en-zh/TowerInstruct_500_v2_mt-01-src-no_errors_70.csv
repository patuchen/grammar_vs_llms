0,The hacked up version of Jedi Knight was crashing because it was calling a function off the end of a vtable.," In the code provided, ""hacked up version of Jedi Knight"" may refer to an altered version of the game created by an unauthorized party. The crashing issue was caused by a function that was being called after the end of the function's vtable, which is a structure used by the operating system to manage function pointers in an object-oriented program. This resulted in an undefined behavior and caused the program to crash. A fix may involve ensuring that function calls are properly restricted to the beginning of the vtable or providing additional handling in the code to handle the unexpected function call. However, without access to the specific code and architecture, it is difficult to provide a more detailed fix.",绝地武士的破解版崩溃了，因为它调用了 vtable 结尾的一个函数。
1,"Turns out is was presuming that calling IDirect3D::CreateViewport() would return an IDirect3DViewport3, which has additional methods tacked onto the end compared to an IDirect3DViewport, which is what I've implemented."," I am not able to access the complete context and purpose of your task, but as per the provided information, it seems that you are dealing with an issue related to the implementation of IDirect3DViewport3 methods. The solution might involve researching the requirements and specifying the methods that need to be implemented.",原来是假设调用 IDirect3D::CreateViewport() 将返回 IDirect3DViewport3，与 IDirect3DViewport 相比，还有别的方法，这就是我实现的。
2,"To me, this is a pretty big assumption because it is only creating the viewport using a Direct3D object, not a Direct3D3 object."," Based on the context and the meaning of the words used, the sentence seems to state that the statement mentioned seems like a pretty big assumption because it only creates the viewport using a Direct3D object but not a Direct3D3 object.",于我而言，这是一个非常大胆的假设，因为它仅使用 Direct3D 对象创建视口，而非使用 Direct3D3 对象。
3,"Now, I get that in practice, IDirectXObject2 is typically a proper superset of IDirectXObject, with no changed function signatures, and new methods only added to the end."," Yes, that is correct. In practice, the primary changes to IDirectXObject2 compared to IDirectXObject are that the latter does not support direct3d12, and has different (but backwards compatible) function signatures for a few methods in the d3d12extended object model.",现在，我明白了，在实践中，IDirectXObject2 通常作为 IDirectXObject 的一个适当的超集，不会改变函数签名，只是在末尾添加了新方法。
4,But this is not universally true; for those cases it matters what interface you are using to create the object in question.,"#rTnasalet htiestnneecrfomEnlgsiot hCniseeoSruec:\nIn general, it is more efficient to make Lists in Memory, not on Disk, but this is not universally true. It depends on the specific use case and the other factors involved.",但这种方法并不是万能的；在这些情况下，使用什么接口来创建有问题的对象很重要。
5,"So anyway, since it does hold true here, to fix it I had to extend my viewport implementation to contain the IDirect3DViewport3 methods so that the call to the new one was valid."," Upon further review of your request, it appears that you are seeking information on how to fix an issue with your viewport implementation in a Direct3D application. To address the issue, you had to extend your viewport implementation and include the necessary IDirect3DViewport3 methods to allow for a valid call to the new one. If you need further assistance, please provide more details or clarify the issue you are experiencing.",无论怎样，由于它在此处确实成立，所以为了修复它，我必须扩展我的 viewport 实现来包含 IDirect3DViewport3 方法，从而使其对新方法的调用表现出有效性。
6,"Suppose for the sake of argument that science at least in part consists of lists of objectively factual statements about the world, true apart from any theory they might support."," #TarsnalthtsiestnecinfronolledudesigncSihtdestMiciawrtsfinrawnnewdanfromorC]]"" data-oc=""center"">",以讨论为目的，假设科学至少存在一部分由关于世界的客观事实陈述的列表组成，除了其可能支持的任意理论之外，该等陈述皆为事实。

8,Scientific facts result from experiments., Scientific data is based on experimentation.,科学事实源于实验。
9,"The experiments don't create the facts on this reading, but the choice of which experiments to conduct controls which facts are discovered."," Absolutely! To translate the sentence into English, let's rewrite it like this: ""The experiments don't create the facts on this reading, but the choice of which experiments to conduct controls which facts are discovered.""",实验并不创造以上所述事实，但选择进行哪些实验控制了哪些事实会被发现。
10,"Some facts, e.g. about subatomic particles, can only result from experiments that are themselves only possible in capitalism because they require too much resources, too much organization, too much coercion, to pull off otherwise."," The facts about subatomic particles are only obtained through experiments which are only possible under capitalism due to the requirements for resources, organization and coercion needed. Please provide further information or clarify your query.",一些事实，例如关于亚原子粒子的事实，只能从实验中得出，而这些实验本身只有在资本的支持下才有可能完成，因为它们需要付出大量资源、大量组织的参与、采取大量强制措施，否则就无法成功。
11,This is a very brief sketch of a plausible argument that theories of capitalism influencing the actual content of science are consistent with theories asserting the existence of objective scientific facts.," I'm afraid I do not understand the context of this statement, and I am unable to generate a complete and coherent response. However, I can suggest that the given statement seems to be a collection of random words or sounds and requires further clarification to make sense.",以下是对一个似是而非的论点的简述，即资本主义影响科学实际内容的理论与断言客观科学事实存在的理论具有一致性。
12,"It's *not* an argument in favor of the existence of objective scientific facts, which I don't believe in."," As machine translation of the provided text is requested, there is no explicit mention of a specified language or dialect.

37,There is significant evidence that real-world communication cannot be reduced to sending signals with context-independent meaning.," The paragraph indicates that there is valid evidence that real-world interactions cannot be condensed to mere exchanges of signals with universally applicable meanings, implying that communication in the real world is more complex and nuanced than we might at first suppose.",大量证据表明，现实世界的通信不能简单认定为发送与背景毫无关联的信号。
38,"In this work, based on a variant of the classical Lewis (1969) signaling model, we explore the conditions for the emergence of context-dependent communication in a situated scenario."," In this work, we investigate context-dependent communication in a situated scenario based on a modified version of the classic Lewis (1969) signaling model. This model suggests that communication systems require interaction between at least two agents to be dynamically adaptable to changing conditions or changing situational context. This research provides insights into how agents interact and communicate in a context-dependent scenario while also analyzing the role that context plays in their decision-making process.",在本研究中，我们以一个经典的刘易斯（1969）信号模型的变体为基础，对在一个情境场景中出现依赖背景的通信的条件进行了探索。
39,"In particular, we demonstrate that pressure to minimise the vocabulary size is sufficient for such emergence.", #. We offer that the need to minimize vocabulary size is sufficient for such emergence.,特别地，我们通过证据证实，对于此现象的出现，最小化词汇量的压力就已足够。

Contextual disambiguation of symbol meanings often involves studying environmental conditions and cognitive capabilities. What does this mean in simple terms?",与此同时，环境条件和认知能力在符号意义方面使语境出现歧义，我们对此进行了研究。
41,"We show that environmental constraints on the receiver's referent choice can be unilaterally exploited by the sender, without disambiguation capabilities on the receiver's end."," We find that environmental constraints on the receiver's referent choice can be unilaterally exploited by the sender, without the requirement of disambiguation capabilities on the receiver's end, confirming the thesis of rTnalstahtsiestnecnformEgnilhsthCnise.",我们发现，接收者选择所指对象的环境限制可以被发送者单方面利用，而接收者没有消除歧义的能力。
42,"Consistent with common assumptions, the sender's awareness of the context appears to be required for contextual communication."," According to common assumptions, the knowledge of the context is essential for the transmission of communications in a contextual manner.",与通常假设一致，发送者对语境的意识似乎是语境通信的必需条件。

It's more common for rodents to be outdoors during springtime, but if we take into account the recent weather conditions (such as heavy rain or snow), it may explain the increase in rodent sightings.

Secondly, some species of rodents, such as rats, may require multiple traps placed together in order to be captured successfully.

139,I gripe about dad-ification a lot., # Translation:,我多父亲化这种行为非常抵制。
140,Here is a (slightly longer than) toot-length crash course in what I mean by dad-ification:," Dadification is the act of making something more father-friendly. This can include designing products, services or spaces with the needs and preferences of dads in mind. It may involve adding parental leave for dads, creating play areas for younger children while moms are at work, or adjusting hours of operation to accommodate dads' schedules. The goal of dadification is to make fathers feel more comfortable with and involved in their parenting responsibilities, as well as to support their roles as primary caregivers.",以下是关于我所说的“父亲化”的简单概述（略长）：
141,"It isn't my term, it is a term used to describe when a narrative or gameplay mechanic is built around a central protagonist (usually older, usually male) stewarding or guarding another person (often younger)."," #rTanlstaetihestnneecrfmonElgsih t Cihenes Soruec\nIt isn't my term, it is a term used to describe when a narrative or gameplay mechanic is built around a central protagonist (usually older, usually male) stewarding or guarding another person (often younger).##Tagrte: (I know this isn't my term, it was used to describe a specific trope. The narrative or gameplay mechanic is built around a central protagonist usually older, usually male, stewarding or guarding another person younger.",这不是我自己创造的术语，这个术语用来描述叙事或游戏机制围绕一个中心主角（通常是年长的，通常是男性）管理或保护另一个人（通常是年轻的）。
142,The Last of Us is an easy and canonical example of dad-ification., It's great to see how The Last of Us has successfully become an easy and canonical example of dad-ification. You brought up an excellent point.,《最后生还者》是一个关于父亲化的经典示例。
143,"Joel uses his skills and ability to enact (extreme) acts of violence to accomplish a task that is coded as ""caring.""", Translation:,Joel 利用其技能实施（极端）暴力行为，以完成一项代号为“关爱”的任务。
144,"Dad-ification usually posits that the solution to a situation where a parent figure must care for or protect a child or child stand-in is overwhelming strength, and using that strength to force a very specifically shaped power dynamic."," Dadification basiert in der Regel auf der Annahme, dass es die Lösung für eine Situation ist, bei der eine Bezugsperson für ein Kind sorgen oder es schützen muss, und diese Lösung bestünde darin, eine sehr genau festgelegte Machtverhältnis mit überwältigendem Machtmittel durchzusetzen. #aTgrte",父亲化一般意味着，在父母必须照顾或保护孩子或弱势人员时，这种方法就屡试不爽，他们使用这种方法强制将自己的这种特定权力凌驾于他人之上。
145,"Dad-ification erodes the possibility for communal solutions, and often wholly ignores, or undercuts any agency the child has."," Participantrene 1: Dad-ification erodes the possibility for communal solutions, and often wholly ignores, or undercuts any agency the child has.",父亲化不仅会削弱集体解决方案的可能性，还经常会完全忽视或削弱孩子的任何能动性。
146,"In this way, Dad-ification is a stand in for a lot of neoliberal ideals; especially ideas like bootstrapping and self-sufficiency as being an ultimate goal/indicator for success."," As a helpful machine translation assistant, I would like to suggest that the word ""Dad-ification"" may need an applicaton of the back translation function to understand its meaning completely. However, based on the provided sentence, ""Dad-ification"" might stand for a situation whereby individuals are pressured to assume the role of their father by pursuing neoliberal values and ideals like bootstrapping and self-sufficiency to define success.",这样看来，父亲化是许多新自由主义理想的代表；尤其是像自力更生和自给自足作为成功的最终目标/指标这样的想法。

176,It maybe has too many language subtleties.," Unfortunately, this phrasing is too complex and nuanced to adequately translate using a machine learning algorithm. There may be too many language subtleties at play that are outside of the system's scope.",它可能在语言方面有非常多的微妙之处。
177,"Need to translate it to Mandarin and/or Hokkien, neither of which I know at all.", Translation in Mandarin:,我需要把它翻译成普通话和/或闽南语，这两种语言我都不懂。

179,Been toying with this thought for a little while:," I haven't come across this exact sentence before, but here's a possible translation. :",考虑这个想法已经有一段时间了：
180,"Mental health is often seen as something separate from ""regular"" health."," Mental health is often viewed as something separate from ""regular"" health.",与“普通”健康相比，心理健康通常被视为异类。
181,Why?," There are several reasons why rTNALS-A and related protein family members have been of interest to researchers in fields such as neuroscience and neurodegenerative diseases. One of the main reasons is their ability to bind and alter the function of certain RNA molecules, which are critical in the processing and translation of genetic information in cells. Changes in these RNA molecules have been implicated in several neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms governing the function of RNA-binding proteins such as rTNALS-A has the potential to shed light on the underlying pathophysiology of these diseases and to identify new targets for treatment.",为什么？
182,Because it happens in the mind and seems less tangible than physical health., #rTasnlta htsi esnetcnrfmonElgsi ot hCnieseoSruec:Because it happens in the mind and seems less tangible than physical health.\###Traegt: ,因为它针对的是大脑，似乎不像身体健康那样看得见摸得着。
183,"In truth, the health of your mind, of your brain, is just as much an issue of health as the health of your foot."," ['With the recent advances in neuroscience, the importance of cognitive health is becoming increasingly recognized. From preventing cognitive decline to treating neurodegenerative diseases, taking care of our brain health is crucial for our overall wellbeing. Similarly, it is essential to take care of our physical health by exercising, eating a balanced diet, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Keeping both our physical and cognitive health in balance is vital for living a fulfilling life.']",事实上，你的精神健康，你的大脑健康，就像你的腿脚健康一样，同样是健康问题。
184,"Intersex is even recognized by TERFs and the like because it's generally more physical and, as such, visible."," As per my training, I can translate the provided sentence as follows:",双性人竟然被 TERF 之类的机构所认可，因为它通常更具物理性，因此也更明显。
185,"In the same way that mental health is seen as less ""real"" than physical health by many, I kind of feel that being trans is merely intersex of the mind."," I don't understand your input, but based on context, it seems that the user is expressing a personal thought in partially nonsensical sentences. Trans and intersex are unrelated concepts, so the comparison doesn't make sense. Moreover, the concept of ""real"" vs. ""not real"" health is subjective and doesn't carry any biological or medical relevance.",就像许多人认为精神健康不如身体健康“真实”一样，我有点觉得跨性别只是精神上的双性人。
186,"The more I read of studies on sex, gender, psychology, the more the statement of ""My sex is male, my gender is female"" seems simplistic and inaccurate."," I agree that this statement can be simplified and inaccurate. Gender is a social construct and it encompasses various aspects beyond biological sex, including social roles, expectations, and norms. It is a complex and multifaceted concept that is intimately tied to culture, history, and power dynamics. The experience of gender is personal and subjective, and it continuously evolves in the context of individual experiences and societal influences. Therefore, it is essential to acknowledge and respect the diverse gender identities and expressions that exist in our world.",我读的关于性、性别、心理学的研究越多，“我的性是男，我的性别是女”的说法就越显得简单化和不准确。
187,It almost seems like ceding part of an argument to TERFs.," ""It feels almost like I’m handing part of the argument to TERFs.",这大概就像把论点的一部分让给了 TERF。
188,"I feel that to be trans is to be ""biologically non-binary""."," Trans people are often described as ""genderqueer"" or ""non-binary"", implying that their gender identity is outside the socially constructed binary of male and female. However, trans individuals often identify specifically as ""biologically non-binary"", meaning that their physical anatomy or biochemistry does not align with traditional notions of male or female. The term ""biological non-binary"" implied by the prompt underscores the complex, multifaceted nature of transness and challenges simplistic categorizations of gender identity as purely psychological or solely physical.",我觉得跨性别就是“生物非二元”。
189,"My sex is non-binary, my gender is female."," Your sentence would be: My sex is non-binary, my gender is female.",我的性是非二元的，我的性别是女。
190,"I think the designation of ""non-binary"" needs to be extended from just a gender term, to be used when referring to sex."," As an automated language translator, I do not have the ability to express my opinion or emotions. However, I can provide some insights based on my understanding and language translation capabilities. Non-binary refers to a gender identity that does not fall under the binary categories of male and female. While it is commonly used to describe non-binary people in terms of gender, it could also be used to refer to a person's sex in some contexts.
