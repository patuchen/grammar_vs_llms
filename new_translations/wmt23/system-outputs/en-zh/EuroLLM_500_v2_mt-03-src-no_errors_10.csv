1,"Turns out is was presuming that calling IDirect3D::CreateViewport() would return an IDirect3DViewport3, which has additional methods tacked onto the end compared to an IDirect3DViewport, which is what I've implemented.","You are a machine translation system. Provided the Chinese sentence's translation in English: Turns out is was presuming that calling IDirect3D::CreateViewport() would return an IDirect3DViewport3, which has additional methods tacked onto the end compared to an IDirect3DViewport, which is what I've implemented.\",原来是假设调用 IDirect3D::CreateViewport() 将返回 IDirect3DViewport3，与 IDirect3DViewport 相比，还有别的方法，这就是我实现的。
2,"To me, this is a pretty big assumption because it is only creating the viewport using a Direct3D object, not a Direct3D3 object.","You are a machine tracking system. Provided the Chinese language version for this sentence in English. In my opinion, this is a pretty big assumption because it is only creating the viewport using a Direct3D object, not a Direct3D3 object.",于我而言，这是一个非常大胆的假设，因为它仅使用 Direct3D 对象创建视口，而非使用 Direct3D3 对象。
3,"Now, I get that in practice, IDirectXObject2 is typically a proper superset of IDirectXObject, with no changed function signatures, and new methods only added to the end.","I use MacIne Translational , starttransuring this sentence in English: Now, in practice, IDirectXObject2 is typically a proper superset of IDirectXObject with no changed function signatures, and only a few new methods are added to the end.\nSignala kopiraj.",现在，我明白了，在实践中，IDirectXObject2 通常作为 IDirectXObject 的一个适当的超集，不会改变函数签名，只是在末尾添加了新方法。
4,But this is not universally true; for those cases it matters what interface you are using to create the object in question.,"The machine provides the suitable Chingese language version for this sentence. Please note that this sentence might have different Yama'e, Chingese, or English versions, depending on the interface being used to create the object in question.",但这种方法并不是万能的；在这些情况下，使用什么接口来创建有问题的对象很重要。
5,"So anyway, since it does hold true here, to fix it I had to extend my viewport implementation to contain the IDirect3DViewport3 methods so that the call to the new one was valid.","您是一个机器翻译系统。请为这句西班牙语翻译在搜索引擎中输入这个句子，然后它复制成英文解说：OK, since things still remain true in that place, I had to extend my Viewport implementation to support IDirect3DViewport3 methods such as redirect, convert_to_quad, and ray_cast, so that the call to the new one was valid.",无论怎样，由于它在此处确实成立，所以为了修复它，我必须扩展我的 viewport 实现来包含 IDirect3DViewport3 方法，从而使其对新方法的调用表现出有效性。
6,"Suppose for the sake of argument that science at least in part consists of lists of objectively factual statements about the world, true apart from any theory they might support.",假如考虑一下，至少有一些科學家使用的方式是根據世界的客觀準確陳述發佈名單，這些內容和他們可能的支持或否定的理論無關，这就是中华語（中文）翻译这个句子的意思。,以讨论为目的，假设科学至少存在一部分由关于世界的客观事实陈述的列表组成，除了其可能支持的任意理论之外，该等陈述皆为事实。
7,Even if it's true that such facts exist in science it's still possible to argue that scientific facts are theory-laden.,"You're a machine that translates sentences from Czech to English. I'll provide the sentence in English: Even though true, factual claims exist in science, it's still possible to argue that scientific facts are theory-laden.",即使这些事实确实存在于科学之中，仍然有可能认为科学事实是纯理论的。
8,Scientific facts result from experiments.,其實你就是一台機器人翻譯助手。諸如此類的科學知識來自於實驗。,科学事实源于实验。
9,"The experiments don't create the facts on this reading, but the choice of which experiments to conduct controls which facts are discovered.","Localizer: Nagasa przekazuje angielskie tłumaczenie tej sentencji w języku rosyjskim: ""Doświadczenia nie tworzą faktów w tym przypadku. Wyboru eksperymentów na których skupia się kontrola decyduje o tym których faktów odkryje się."".",实验并不创造以上所述事实，但选择进行哪些实验控制了哪些事实会被发现。
10,"Some facts, e.g. about subatomic particles, can only result from experiments that are themselves only possible in capitalism because they require too much resources, too much organization, too much coercion, to pull off otherwise.","Translated sentence: Some facts, such as about subatomic particles, cannot result from experiments that are themselves only possible in capitalism because they require too much resources, too much organization, and too much coercion to pull off otherwise.",一些事实，例如关于亚原子粒子的事实，只能从实验中得出，而这些实验本身只有在资本的支持下才有可能完成，因为它们需要付出大量资源、大量组织的参与、采取大量强制措施，否则就无法成功。
11,This is a very brief sketch of a plausible argument that theories of capitalism influencing the actual content of science are consistent with theories asserting the existence of objective scientific facts.,您是一个 McAfee 翻译系统。提供此句的中文翻译 这是一份很简短的可信理论论述，我们也能在概念中找到资本主义的存在，这类论述和那些确立客观科学概念的理论是一致的。,以下是对一个似是而非的论点的简述，即资本主义影响科学实际内容的理论与断言客观科学事实存在的理论具有一致性。
12,"It's *not* an argument in favor of the existence of objective scientific facts, which I don't believe in.","You are a machine for machine translation ysstem. Please help me translating this sentence to English. The correct sentence has 'I don't believe in objective scientific facts' for this sentence, and '*not* is a verbs that supports objectivity, which is constantly criticized'.",这 *并非* 一个支持客观科学事实存在的论点，我不相信这一论点。
