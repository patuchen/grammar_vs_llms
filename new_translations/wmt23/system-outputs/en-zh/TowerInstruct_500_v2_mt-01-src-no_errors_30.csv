0,The hacked up version of Jedi Knight was crashing because it was calling a function off the end of a vtable., ###: Translated:,绝地武士的破解版崩溃了，因为它调用了 vtable 结尾的一个函数。
1,"Turns out is was presuming that calling IDirect3D::CreateViewport() would return an IDirect3DViewport3, which has additional methods tacked onto the end compared to an IDirect3DViewport, which is what I've implemented."," Yes, I've translated your question and I understood that you were having trouble with an error message related to calling IDirect3D::CreateViewport() in your program. The error message suggested that you were expecting a particular IDirect3DViewport3 object to be returned instead of the object you received. Based on this, I've made sure to include the correct syntax and method names.",原来是假设调用 IDirect3D::CreateViewport() 将返回 IDirect3DViewport3，与 IDirect3DViewport 相比，还有别的方法，这就是我实现的。
2,"To me, this is a pretty big assumption because it is only creating the viewport using a Direct3D object, not a Direct3D3 object.", Translation in Chinese:,于我而言，这是一个非常大胆的假设，因为它仅使用 Direct3D 对象创建视口，而非使用 Direct3D3 对象。
3,"Now, I get that in practice, IDirectXObject2 is typically a proper superset of IDirectXObject, with no changed function signatures, and new methods only added to the end."," Now, I understand that in practice, IDirectXObject2 is typically a \strong{proper superset} of IDirectXObject, with no changed function signatures, and new methods only added to the end.",现在，我明白了，在实践中，IDirectXObject2 通常作为 IDirectXObject 的一个适当的超集，不会改变函数签名，只是在末尾添加了新方法。
4,But this is not universally true; for those cases it matters what interface you are using to create the object in question.," 但这并不能说是万能的;在这种情况下,关键要看你在使用哪个接口创建这类对象",但这种方法并不是万能的；在这些情况下，使用什么接口来创建有问题的对象很重要。
5,"So anyway, since it does hold true here, to fix it I had to extend my viewport implementation to contain the IDirect3DViewport3 methods so that the call to the new one was valid.", 这次所说的问题确实存在，因此为了解决问题，我得扩展 myViewController 中的 viewport 实现，如此一来，新的 viewport 方法的调用就能正常执行了。,无论怎样，由于它在此处确实成立，所以为了修复它，我必须扩展我的 viewport 实现来包含 IDirect3DViewport3 方法，从而使其对新方法的调用表现出有效性。
6,"Suppose for the sake of argument that science at least in part consists of lists of objectively factual statements about the world, true apart from any theory they might support.", - 假设为了论据的目的，科学至少在部分内容上是真实事实准确的说明，而不以任何理论为依赖。,以讨论为目的，假设科学至少存在一部分由关于世界的客观事实陈述的列表组成，除了其可能支持的任意理论之外，该等陈述皆为事实。
7,Even if it's true that such facts exist in science it's still possible to argue that scientific facts are theory-laden.," As per your request, I have translated the given text from English to Chinese.",即使这些事实确实存在于科学之中，仍然有可能认为科学事实是纯理论的。
8,Scientific facts result from experiments., Salut ! Here is your requested translaition:,科学事实源于实验。

The experiments are not the ones that create the facts, but the choice of which experiments are conducted can determine which facts are discovered.",实验并不创造以上所述事实，但选择进行哪些实验控制了哪些事实会被发现。
10,"Some facts, e.g. about subatomic particles, can only result from experiments that are themselves only possible in capitalism because they require too much resources, too much organization, too much coercion, to pull off otherwise."," According to the science of physics, certain facts about subatomic particles can only be discovered through experiments that would not be possible in a non-capitalist environment because they require a lot of resources, organization, and coercion.",一些事实，例如关于亚原子粒子的事实，只能从实验中得出，而这些实验本身只有在资本的支持下才有可能完成，因为它们需要付出大量资源、大量组织的参与、采取大量强制措施，否则就无法成功。
11,This is a very brief sketch of a plausible argument that theories of capitalism influencing the actual content of science are consistent with theories asserting the existence of objective scientific facts., ###Theories of capitalism influencing the actual content of science are consistent with theories asserting the existence of objective scientific facts.#,以下是对一个似是而非的论点的简述，即资本主义影响科学实际内容的理论与断言客观科学事实存在的理论具有一致性。
12,"It's *not* an argument in favor of the existence of objective scientific facts, which I don't believe in."," This is *not* an argument in favor of the existence of objective scientific facts, which I do not believe in.",这 *并非* 一个支持客观科学事实存在的论点，我不相信这一论点。
