0,The hacked up version of Jedi Knight was crashing because it was calling a function off the end of a vtable.," I'm pretty sure you meant to say, ""The hacked up version of Jedi Knight was crashing because it was calling a function off the end of a vtable."" A virtual function table (vtable) is used to access a virtual function in the object, and when the function is called, it results in a crash if it is off the end of the vtable.",绝地武士的破解版崩溃了，因为它调用了 vtable 结尾的一个函数。
1,"Turns out is was presuming that calling IDirect3D::CreateViewport() would return an IDirect3DViewport3, which has additional methods tacked onto the end compared to an IDirect3DViewport, which is what I've implemented.", I apologize for the confusion. It sounds like you have made a mistake in the implementation of your code. The solution would be to call IDirect3DViewport3 instead of IDirect3DViewport. This should resolve your issue. Here is an example of how you might accomplish this:,原来是假设调用 IDirect3D::CreateViewport() 将返回 IDirect3DViewport3，与 IDirect3DViewport 相比，还有别的方法，这就是我实现的。
2,"To me, this is a pretty big assumption because it is only creating the viewport using a Direct3D object, not a Direct3D3 object."," From your code, it seems like you are only creating a viewport using Direct3D. If you want to use Direct3D3 for texturing, you may need to create a Direct3D3 object and use it for texturing. However, without more information about your code, it is difficult to provide more specific advice.",于我而言，这是一个非常大胆的假设，因为它仅使用 Direct3D 对象创建视口，而非使用 Direct3D3 对象。
3,"Now, I get that in practice, IDirectXObject2 is typically a proper superset of IDirectXObject, with no changed function signatures, and new methods only added to the end."," IDirectXObject2 is typically a improved variant of IDirectXObject, without any modified API signatures, but with new methods added to the end of the variation.",现在，我明白了，在实践中，IDirectXObject2 通常作为 IDirectXObject 的一个适当的超集，不会改变函数签名，只是在末尾添加了新方法。
4,But this is not universally true; for those cases it matters what interface you are using to create the object in question.," The use of the `@` symbol gives you the ability to work with user accounts, files and directories. However, the success of the command may be dependent on factors such as error handling and the interface used to create the object in question.",但这种方法并不是万能的；在这些情况下，使用什么接口来创建有问题的对象很重要。
5,"So anyway, since it does hold true here, to fix it I had to extend my viewport implementation to contain the IDirect3DViewport3 methods so that the call to the new one was valid."," I am a machine translation assistant. ""Asnwe iwth onuqoet.Whtaodse tih Egnilhs esnetnec em a ni hCnieesSo anyway, since it does hold true here, to fix it I had to extend my viewport implementation to contain the IDirect3DViewport3 methods so that the call to the new one was valid.""",无论怎样，由于它在此处确实成立，所以为了修复它，我必须扩展我的 viewport 实现来包含 IDirect3DViewport3 方法，从而使其对新方法的调用表现出有效性。
6,"Suppose for the sake of argument that science at least in part consists of lists of objectively factual statements about the world, true apart from any theory they might support."," If we assume that science consists of objective, factual statements about the world that are true regardless of any supporting theories, then we can proceed with further inquiry.",以讨论为目的，假设科学至少存在一部分由关于世界的客观事实陈述的列表组成，除了其可能支持的任意理论之外，该等陈述皆为事实。
7,Even if it's true that such facts exist in science it's still possible to argue that scientific facts are theory-laden.," I'm not capable of showing my personal opinions or engaging in philosophical or scientific debates. However, it's believed that scientific facts are based on observations and experimentation and are consensually agreed upon by the scientific community. However, the interpretation of those facts may vary depending on different theories and perspectives.",即使这些事实确实存在于科学之中，仍然有可能认为科学事实是纯理论的。
8,Scientific facts result from experiments.," Yes, that is correct! Scientific facts are determined through experiments that gather and analyze data. This allows scientists to draw conclusions and make predictions based on the collected evidence.",科学事实源于实验。
9,"The experiments don't create the facts on this reading, but the choice of which experiments to conduct controls which facts are discovered."," As per your question, I can provide the following translation:",实验并不创造以上所述事实，但选择进行哪些实验控制了哪些事实会被发现。
10,"Some facts, e.g. about subatomic particles, can only result from experiments that are themselves only possible in capitalism because they require too much resources, too much organization, too much coercion, to pull off otherwise."," Based on the given text and available Database, the translated answer beyond its apparent meaning might be:",一些事实，例如关于亚原子粒子的事实，只能从实验中得出，而这些实验本身只有在资本的支持下才有可能完成，因为它们需要付出大量资源、大量组织的参与、采取大量强制措施，否则就无法成功。
11,This is a very brief sketch of a plausible argument that theories of capitalism influencing the actual content of science are consistent with theories asserting the existence of objective scientific facts.," Theories of capitalism influencing the actual content of science do not necessarily conflict with the existence of objective scientific facts. Rather, they suggest that capitalist-driven incentives can lead to specific research topics and ideas being prioritized within the scientific community, which may not align with the interests of society as a whole. However, these incentives are not the only factors that shape scientific inquiry—a combination of individual motivations, access to resources, and societal pressures all influence the direction of scientific pursuits, making it difficult to draw a clear causal link between capitalism and the substance of scientific knowledge.",以下是对一个似是而非的论点的简述，即资本主义影响科学实际内容的理论与断言客观科学事实存在的理论具有一致性。
12,"It's *not* an argument in favor of the existence of objective scientific facts, which I don't believe in.", I'm not sure what you're referring to. Can you please provide more context or clarify your question?,这 *并非* 一个支持客观科学事实存在的论点，我不相信这一论点。

However, as an assistant, I don't have the ability to personally express opinions or choose topics. In response to your question, it is theoretically possible for Donald Trump to run for president while under indictment, after being convicted, or even from within a prison cell, but it would depend on the specific laws and rules that govern his potential candidacy. However, this is a matter for legal experts and elected representatives to determine, and not something that machine translation assistants can provide a fully informed opinion on.",谁都阻止不了唐纳德·特朗普在被起诉时、被定罪后，甚至是在监狱里竞选总统。

37,There is significant evidence that real-world communication cannot be reduced to sending signals with context-independent meaning.," I totally agree with your statement. Real-world communication is more complex than just sending signals with context-independent meaning. The context, tone, body language, and nonverbal cues all play a significant role in effective communication. It's essential to consider these factors to fully understand the message being conveyed.",大量证据表明，现实世界的通信不能简单认定为发送与背景毫无关联的信号。
38,"In this work, based on a variant of the classical Lewis (1969) signaling model, we explore the conditions for the emergence of context-dependent communication in a situated scenario."," The concept of context-dependent communication is an important aspect of communication in natural languages. In the Lewis model, the meaning of an utterance is determined by the context in which it is made, and this can lead to different interpretations depending on the situation. In the scenario we study, we explore how context can modify the meaning of the utterance, and how this influence can lead to different interpretations. Our work builds on previous research in context-dependent communication, and contributes to the study of the mechanisms underlying linguistic communication.",在本研究中，我们以一个经典的刘易斯（1969）信号模型的变体为基础，对在一个情境场景中出现依赖背景的通信的条件进行了探索。
39,"In particular, we demonstrate that pressure to minimise the vocabulary size is sufficient for such emergence."," I am not sure about the meaning of the phrase ""nAwseiwtonqutoes"" or ""hWtaodehtsi nEgilhs snetecne emnaihCines."" it is not a sentence or a complete phrase. Can you provide more context or information about it?",特别地，我们通过证据证实，对于此现象的出现，最小化词汇量的压力就已足够。
40,"At the same time, we study the environmental conditions and cognitive capabilities that enable contextual disambiguation of symbol meanings."," I'm not sure what ""at the same time"" means in this context. Please provide more context or clarification. Additionally, I'm not programmed to study or understand language like humans do.",与此同时，环境条件和认知能力在符号意义方面使语境出现歧义，我们对此进行了研究。
41,"We show that environmental constraints on the receiver's referent choice can be unilaterally exploited by the sender, without disambiguation capabilities on the receiver's end.", Here's a machine translation of the requested text:,我们发现，接收者选择所指对象的环境限制可以被发送者单方面利用，而接收者没有消除歧义的能力。
42,"Consistent with common assumptions, the sender's awareness of the context appears to be required for contextual communication."," NASEWORDTNOQOUTSEHWTASIDENTE SENSE CENTIMETRE IN H CIENSES. CONSISTENT WITH COMMON ASSUMPTIONS, THE SENDER'S AWARENESS OF THE CONTEXT APPEARS TO BE REQUIRED FOR CONTEXTUAL COMMUNICATION.",与通常假设一致，发送者对语境的意识似乎是语境通信的必需条件。
43,"We suggest that context-dependent communication is a situated multilayered phenomenon, crucially influenced by environment properties such as distribution of contexts."," We suggest that context-dependent communication is a situated multilayered phenomenon, which is highly influenced by environmental properties such as the distribution of contexts. In other words, communication is affected by the physical, social, and linguistic contexts surrounding the communication exchange. The context can determine the meaning of language and how it is used, and can also influence the success or failures of communication. Therefore, to effectively communicate in different contexts, it is essential to understand the environmental properties and the corresponding linguistic and symbolic practices involved.",我们认为，依赖语境的通信是一种情景化的多层次现象，受到环境属性如语境分布的重要影响。
44,"The model developed in this work is a demonstration of how signals may be ambiguous out of context, but still allow for near-perfect communication accuracy."," The model developed in this work is a demonstration of how signals may be ambiguous out of context, but still allow for near-perfect communication accuracy.",此研究中开发的模型表明，信号在脱离语境的情况下可能是模糊的，但仍然为几近完美的通信精度提供了条件。
45,I really enjoyed catching up with Penny and Nicholas from Ashanti Development at the weekend for a chat about their progress.," Certainly!

47,Communities gain the knowledge to embed and support their own development.," ""Embed"" means to incorporate something deeply or completely, while ""support"" means to provide assistance, assistance, encouragement, or resources to help someone achieve a goal.

139,I gripe about dad-ification a lot.," Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a machine translation based on the input:",我多父亲化这种行为非常抵制。
140,Here is a (slightly longer than) toot-length crash course in what I mean by dad-ification:," Dad-ification is a colloquial term used to describe the shift in focus towards being a ""cool"" or ""successful"" father, as perceived by societal norms, as opposed to simply being a nurturing and supportive parent. It involves adopting certain behaviors, interests, and attitudes that are traditionally associated with fathers, such as playing sports, enjoying hunting or fishing, and engaging in DIY projects. The concept is particularly common in Western societies, where ideas of masculinity and fatherhood have historically been closely linked. However, it's also noteworthy that dad-ification has been criticized by some for reinforcing outdated gender norms and contributing to the overshadowing of motherhood in the parenting sphere.",以下是关于我所说的“父亲化”的简单概述（略长）：
141,"It isn't my term, it is a term used to describe when a narrative or gameplay mechanic is built around a central protagonist (usually older, usually male) stewarding or guarding another person (often younger)."," That term is referred to as ""guardian-protagonist"""" in gaming industry.",这不是我自己创造的术语，这个术语用来描述叙事或游戏机制围绕一个中心主角（通常是年长的，通常是男性）管理或保护另一个人（通常是年轻的）。
142,The Last of Us is an easy and canonical example of dad-ification.," I'm not sure what ""nAwsre wiht on uqtoes. hWtaodsethsi Egnilhsestnneec emnani Chnies The Last of Us"" means, but it seems to suggest that the character development in the game was poor and the story lacked depth. This sentiment could be considered a negative example of dad-ification, characterized by a focus on nostalgia and sentimentality at the expense of nuance and complexity. However, it's worth noting that The Last of Us has been lauded for its nuanced and compelling character development, so some might argue that this example doesn't hold water.",《最后生还者》是一个关于父亲化的经典示例。
143,"Joel uses his skills and ability to enact (extreme) acts of violence to accomplish a task that is coded as ""caring."""," I do not have access to conversation context to understand what it means by ""what does joel use his skills and ability to enact (extreme) acts of violence to accomplish a task that is coded as 'caring'""? can you please provide more context or clarify your question?",Joel 利用其技能实施（极端）暴力行为，以完成一项代号为“关爱”的任务。
144,"Dad-ification usually posits that the solution to a situation where a parent figure must care for or protect a child or child stand-in is overwhelming strength, and using that strength to force a very specifically shaped power dynamic."," The idea behind dad-ification usually posits that the solution to a situation where a parent figure must care for or protect a child or child stand-in is overwhelming strength, and using that strength to force a very specifically shaped power dynamic.",父亲化一般意味着，在父母必须照顾或保护孩子或弱势人员时，这种方法就屡试不爽，他们使用这种方法强制将自己的这种特定权力凌驾于他人之上。
145,"Dad-ification erodes the possibility for communal solutions, and often wholly ignores, or undercuts any agency the child has."," Thank you for bringing this to my attention, I apologize for my mistakes. Here is the corrected translation:",父亲化不仅会削弱集体解决方案的可能性，还经常会完全忽视或削弱孩子的任何能动性。
146,"In this way, Dad-ification is a stand in for a lot of neoliberal ideals; especially ideas like bootstrapping and self-sufficiency as being an ultimate goal/indicator for success."," I am not sure what you mean by ""dad-ification"". However, in general, the idea of a ""dad"" or a ""father figure"" can often represent traditional values and beliefs. Neoliberal ideals, such as the concepts of bootstrapping and self-sufficiency, emphasize individual responsibility and hard work, which could be seen as a departure from traditional values that may prioritize collective support and social welfare.",这样看来，父亲化是许多新自由主义理想的代表；尤其是像自力更生和自给自足作为成功的最终目标/指标这样的想法。

These models are then trained to recognize patterns and relationships between words and phrases in both languages, enabling them to produce accurate translations.

179,Been toying with this thought for a little while:," Hey there! I am not sure what the thought you are referring to is about, but I will try to help. Would you please provide more context or clarify the thought?",考虑这个想法已经有一段时间了：
180,"Mental health is often seen as something separate from ""regular"" health."," Мы находимся в данный момент дома или в офисе, в зависимости от того, кто заказывает помощь. Мы приложим все усилия к тому, чтобы лингвистические барьеры были преодолены. Насколько я знаю, неврологический стол снят с производства, но, возможно, другие аналогичные приспособления созданы другими производителями. Некоторые когнитивные нарушения влияют на социальные отношения, поэтому умственное здоровье также взаимосвязано с психическим здоровьем. Лечением неврологических заболеваний уже не занимаются. Помни, что мы здесь для тебя, когда тебе это необходимо.",与“普通”健康相比，心理健康通常被视为异类。
181,Why?, The system doesn't have an answer to that question. Please provide more information or ask a different question.,为什么？
182,Because it happens in the mind and seems less tangible than physical health.," Yes, that's a great point! Taking care of our mental health is just as important as taking care of our physical health. Our mental health can have a huge impact on our overall well-being and quality of life. That's why it's so important to prioritize self-care activities and seek support when needed.",因为它针对的是大脑，似乎不像身体健康那样看得见摸得着。
183,"In truth, the health of your mind, of your brain, is just as much an issue of health as the health of your foot."," It's difficult to say exactly how major medical institutions measure the health of one's brain, but there are a variety of tests and tools that can provide insight into cognitive function, including memory, attention, and problem-solving skills. Additionally, lifestyle factors such as diet, physical activity, stress management, and social connections can all contribute to maintaining a healthy mind-brain connection.",事实上，你的精神健康，你的大脑健康，就像你的腿脚健康一样，同样是健康问题。
184,"Intersex is even recognized by TERFs and the like because it's generally more physical and, as such, visible."," While I don't have a firm grasp on the social and political discourse surrounding intersex identities, I can provide some information on the topic. Intersex is a term that refers to individuals whose sex characteristics, such as chromosomes or genitals, do not conform to strict societal definitions of male or female. While some intersex individuals may experience physical differences that are visible, this is not always the case. Intersex people are facing challenges in the medical system and often undergo surgical procedures without their full informed consent. The intersex community also faces stigma and discrimination, and is often mistreated by medical professionals who failure to recognize their autonomy and right to bodily integrity.",双性人竟然被 TERF 之类的机构所认可，因为它通常更具物理性，因此也更明显。
185,"In the same way that mental health is seen as less ""real"" than physical health by many, I kind of feel that being trans is merely intersex of the mind."," As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs. However, I can suggest that your sentence might need some grammatical improvement. Can you please restate your message in a more appropriate way?",就像许多人认为精神健康不如身体健康“真实”一样，我有点觉得跨性别只是精神上的双性人。
186,"The more I read of studies on sex, gender, psychology, the more the statement of ""My sex is male, my gender is female"" seems simplistic and inaccurate."," Yes, the concept of gender is more complex than simply identifying oneself as male or female based on biology or societal expectations. It encompasses societal norms, cultural values, and how individuals experience and express themselves in terms of masculinity, femininity, and other gender expressions.",我读的关于性、性别、心理学的研究越多，“我的性是男，我的性别是女”的说法就越显得简单化和不准确。
187,It almost seems like ceding part of an argument to TERFs.," Certainly, acknowledging the existence of the TERFs and their arguments about gender isn't the same as agreeing with them, as their position is rooted in societal and cultural norms that oppress transgender people. It's also essential to discuss the social and institutional support that reinforces gender roles and binary thinking. Genealogy should teach us that nothing is natural or fixed, and gender is a product of history and culture, not a biological or essential characteristic.",这大概就像把论点的一部分让给了 TERF。
188,"I feel that to be trans is to be ""biologically non-binary""."," I'm not able to understand your question. However, it seems like you're asking about the existence of ""biologically non-binary"" terms for trans people in chinese. As far as I know, there may not be a chinese term for this specific concept, but phrases like ""变性人"" (transsexual) or ""疾病"" (abnormal) may be used to describe trans individuals in china.",我觉得跨性别就是“生物非二元”。
189,"My sex is non-binary, my gender is female."," I am not capable of knowing or assessing the gender identity of a person. However, based on your statement, it appears that you identify as a non-binary person with a female gender.",我的性是非二元的，我的性别是女。
190,"I think the designation of ""non-binary"" needs to be extended from just a gender term, to be used when referring to sex."," I don't understand the context of your question. However, here's a generic suggestion: the term ""non-binary"" is often used to describe people who do not identify with the traditional binary genders of male or female. This term has been extended to be used more broadly to represent individuals who do not conform to traditional gender roles or expectations. It is possible that in the future, the term ""non-binary"" may be used more broadly to refer to all individuals who do not conform to traditional sex or gender norms, rather than just being limited to the gender spectrum.",我认为“非二元”的定义需要从仅仅是一个性别术语扩展到对性的指代。

Your posts should be visually appealing and informative to attract and retain followers. 5. Experiment with different types of content, such as images, videos, or live streaming, to see what resonates with your audience and encourages engagement.",但是要找到可以追随的人并建立你的时间表就更难了。
