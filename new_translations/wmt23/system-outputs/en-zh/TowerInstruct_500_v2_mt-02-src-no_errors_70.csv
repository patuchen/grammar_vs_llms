0,The hacked up version of Jedi Knight was crashing because it was calling a function off the end of a vtable.," I can suggest that the word ""hacked"" in your sentence suggests it was altered in an unauthorized way. ""Hacked up version"" of software usually suggests it has been altered and caused error. So, you can add ""hacked"" in the sentence to indicate that some unauthorized changes were made to the software.",绝地武士的破解版崩溃了，因为它调用了 vtable 结尾的一个函数。
1,"Turns out is was presuming that calling IDirect3D::CreateViewport() would return an IDirect3DViewport3, which has additional methods tacked onto the end compared to an IDirect3DViewport, which is what I've implemented."," Adding additional methods to an IDirect3DViewport3 is not a problem, but it is important to ensure that your code works correctly with the new methods. You should consider calling IDirect3D3::AddRef() and IDirect3D3::Release() on the returned object to maintain the correct reference count for the object that it represents. Additionally, you should ensure that your code respects the various state flags and parameters that might be used when creating a new viewport.",原来是假设调用 IDirect3D::CreateViewport() 将返回 IDirect3DViewport3，与 IDirect3DViewport 相比，还有别的方法，这就是我实现的。
2,"To me, this is a pretty big assumption because it is only creating the viewport using a Direct3D object, not a Direct3D3 object."," I don't understand your comment. However, I can suggest the following explanation of the given text:",于我而言，这是一个非常大胆的假设，因为它仅使用 Direct3D 对象创建视口，而非使用 Direct3D3 对象。
3,"Now, I get that in practice, IDirectXObject2 is typically a proper superset of IDirectXObject, with no changed function signatures, and new methods only added to the end."," Yes, that's correct. In practice, IDirectXObject2 is often a full superset of IDirectXObject, with no changed function signatures and additional methods added at the end. This ensures backwards compatibility with IDirectXObject, preserves existing source code, and allows developers to use IDirectXObject2 without any additional effort.",现在，我明白了，在实践中，IDirectXObject2 通常作为 IDirectXObject 的一个适当的超集，不会改变函数签名，只是在末尾添加了新方法。
4,But this is not universally true; for those cases it matters what interface you are using to create the object in question.," Yes, you are correct. The efficiency of object creation can vary depending on the programming interface used. Some interfaces may be more efficient than others in terms of resource usage and performance. It's worth considering the interface when designing and optimizing algorithms and systems that involve object creation.",但这种方法并不是万能的；在这些情况下，使用什么接口来创建有问题的对象很重要。
5,"So anyway, since it does hold true here, to fix it I had to extend my viewport implementation to contain the IDirect3DViewport3 methods so that the call to the new one was valid.", Here's a translation in English:,无论怎样，由于它在此处确实成立，所以为了修复它，我必须扩展我的 viewport 实现来包含 IDirect3DViewport3 方法，从而使其对新方法的调用表现出有效性。
6,"Suppose for the sake of argument that science at least in part consists of lists of objectively factual statements about the world, true apart from any theory they might support.", I'll interpret the given text as follows: ,以讨论为目的，假设科学至少存在一部分由关于世界的客观事实陈述的列表组成，除了其可能支持的任意理论之外，该等陈述皆为事实。
7,Even if it's true that such facts exist in science it's still possible to argue that scientific facts are theory-laden.," As a machine translation assistant, I can provide the following explanation:",即使这些事实确实存在于科学之中，仍然有可能认为科学事实是纯理论的。
8,Scientific facts result from experiments., Here are the translated text and its translation in English:,科学事实源于实验。
9,"The experiments don't create the facts on this reading, but the choice of which experiments to conduct controls which facts are discovered."," When selecting which experiments to conduct, the researchers have significant control over which facts are discovered. The experiment is not responsible for determining the facts; instead, it is the researchers' decision based on the specific experimental design.",实验并不创造以上所述事实，但选择进行哪些实验控制了哪些事实会被发现。
10,"Some facts, e.g. about subatomic particles, can only result from experiments that are themselves only possible in capitalism because they require too much resources, too much organization, too much coercion, to pull off otherwise.",,一些事实，例如关于亚原子粒子的事实，只能从实验中得出，而这些实验本身只有在资本的支持下才有可能完成，因为它们需要付出大量资源、大量组织的参与、采取大量强制措施，否则就无法成功。
11,This is a very brief sketch of a plausible argument that theories of capitalism influencing the actual content of science are consistent with theories asserting the existence of objective scientific facts., I don't understand your question. Could you please rephrase it?,以下是对一个似是而非的论点的简述，即资本主义影响科学实际内容的理论与断言客观科学事实存在的理论具有一致性。
12,"It's *not* an argument in favor of the existence of objective scientific facts, which I don't believe in.", *This does not make any sense as a response. Please provide a more comprehensible reply.,这 *并非* 一个支持客观科学事实存在的论点，我不相信这一论点。

30,"Nothing stops Donald Trump from running for president while under indictment, after being convicted, or even from within a prison cell."," converting to english: Donald Trump can run for president while under indictment, and even after being convicted, and even from within a prison cell.",谁都阻止不了唐纳德·特朗普在被起诉时、被定罪后，甚至是在监狱里竞选总统。
31,"If elected, he would undoubtedly pardon himself to get out of prison."," However, his self-pardon wouldn't hold up in court as impeachment is a legal, constitutional remedy for presidential misconduct. A self-pardon is not a legal remedy and cannot be invoked by a sitting president.",如果成功当选，毫无疑问，他会大赦自己离开监狱。
32,But he can't pardon himself out of state prison.," That is not correct. The president can pardon anyone, including himself or herself, although it is not recommended in the context of state prison sentences.",而他无法大赦自己离开州立监狱。
33,It takes the state's governor.," I don't understand the question, please provide more context or clarification.",因为这一点需要州长同意。

36,NY is the best hope for accountability," Absolutely! ""rn"" is a valid punctuation mark. In this sentence, it separates two successive non-words. It is often used to add emphasis or make the sentence more readable. However, for machine translation, it may be better to remove these punctuations to ensure a more accurate and consistent translation.",纽约州肩负着问责的最大希望
37,There is significant evidence that real-world communication cannot be reduced to sending signals with context-independent meaning., Proivedht khorsereft hCniesrtnasaltinofohti Egnlsihestnneec:Various research studies argue against the idea that real-world communication can be reduced to the transmission of signals with context-independent meaning.,大量证据表明，现实世界的通信不能简单认定为发送与背景毫无关联的信号。
38,"In this work, based on a variant of the classical Lewis (1969) signaling model, we explore the conditions for the emergence of context-dependent communication in a situated scenario.", I think the given translation is correct. Could you please clarify if there's any specific language or sentence in the text that you'd like me to help you with?,在本研究中，我们以一个经典的刘易斯（1969）信号模型的变体为基础，对在一个情境场景中出现依赖背景的通信的条件进行了探索。
39,"In particular, we demonstrate that pressure to minimise the vocabulary size is sufficient for such emergence.", I do not understand the context of the sentence. Can you please provide more information or context?,特别地，我们通过证据证实，对于此现象的出现，最小化词汇量的压力就已足够。
40,"At the same time, we study the environmental conditions and cognitive capabilities that enable contextual disambiguation of symbol meanings."," Yes, that is correct. We are trying to understand the environmental conditions and cognitive capabilities that enable contextual disambiguation of symbols in a given language.",与此同时，环境条件和认知能力在符号意义方面使语境出现歧义，我们对此进行了研究。
41,"We show that environmental constraints on the receiver's referent choice can be unilaterally exploited by the sender, without disambiguation capabilities on the receiver's end.", I will translate your message below:,我们发现，接收者选择所指对象的环境限制可以被发送者单方面利用，而接收者没有消除歧义的能力。
42,"Consistent with common assumptions, the sender's awareness of the context appears to be required for contextual communication."," I agree that the awareness of the context is crucial for successful communication. In addition, personal communication styles and preferences also play significant roles in effective conversations.",与通常假设一致，发送者对语境的意识似乎是语境通信的必需条件。
43,"We suggest that context-dependent communication is a situated multilayered phenomenon, crucially influenced by environment properties such as distribution of contexts."," Context-dependent communication is a situated, multilayered phenomenon that is heavily influenced by environmental properties such as the distribution of contexts.",我们认为，依赖语境的通信是一种情景化的多层次现象，受到环境属性如语境分布的重要影响。
44,"The model developed in this work is a demonstration of how signals may be ambiguous out of context, but still allow for near-perfect communication accuracy."," The model developed in this work is a demonstration of how signals may be ambiguous out of context, but still allow for nearly perfect communication accuracy.",此研究中开发的模型表明，信号在脱离语境的情况下可能是模糊的，但仍然为几近完美的通信精度提供了条件。
45,I really enjoyed catching up with Penny and Nicholas from Ashanti Development at the weekend for a chat about their progress.," I am not capable of interpreting human moods, emotions or feelings.

48,I was fortunate enough to spend a memorable six months alongside Nicholas in 2011 supporting a range of projects.," During that time, I had the chance to work with Nicholas on various projects, including some of them which were challenging. He has always been a great mentor and someone who possesses excellent communication skills. As a team player, Nicholas has an outstanding ability to foster a positive and productive work environment. More importantly, Nicholas is very knowledgeable in his field and always willing to share his expertise and provide guidance to those around him. Additionally, he has a keen eye for detail, which was very beneficial in ensuring our projects were executed with precision. I genuinely enjoyed working with Nicholas and would highly recommend him for any project.",2011 年，我有幸与 Nicholas 共同经历了难忘的六个月，为一系列项目提供了支持。
49,"When we caught up at the weekend I was chuffed to hear about progress, particularly with tree planting and farm support.", I am not sure if this is the correct input that the user wanted to present. Could you rephrase the sentence?,周末见面时，得知工作的进展，我很开心，特别是植树和农场获得的支持。

53,The UPS store near me won't allow me to write a label or write on the box.," I don't have specific information about your location or the ups store's policies, but I can suggest some possible solutions. It is possible that the ups store near you has specific rules or restrictions on labeling and marking on their packages. You may want to check their website or contact their customer service for further guidance. Alternatively, if you need to label or write on the box, you might consider using a different shipping service or using a unique label template that does not violate any ups store policies.",我附近的 UPS 商店不允许我手写标签或写产品盒上。
54,The must print the label., The device must print the label.,他们要求必须打印标签。
55,They won't allow me to tell them the address it's going to and who is shipping it., I can suggest that you check the mailing policies of the company you are sending the package to or check with the shipping service provider.

57,"And they always to charge me $2.25 for that ""convenience""."," I suggest that instead of paying $2.25 for the service, you can try using a free Wi-Fi hotspot service that is available in many public places. You can also consider purchasing a mobile hotspot device or a portable Wi-Fi hotspot to enjoy the convenience of Wi-Fi connectivity on the go, without having to rely on expensive and limited hotspot charges.",针对这种“便利”，他们总是向我收取 2.25 美元的费用。
58,The next morning and I can't get past Chris Licht's disgraceful pretense of public service journalism on CNN last night., I don't understand your question. Could you please provide more context?,第二天早上，对于克里斯·利希特昨晚在美国有线电视新闻网伪装不光彩的公共服务新闻，我无法忘记。
59,"It was an outrage, like a symbolic Jan 6 anti-democratic festivus of lies & grievance, self-destructively hosted by American media.", Translation provided:,这真是骇人听闻，就像 1 月 6 日反民主节日，一个象征性的谎言和表达不满的节日，而这是由美国媒体近乎自我毁灭地把持。

66,"I have a very drafty basement, which essentially means I can get a lot of rodents taking refuge."," As an assistant machine translation, I can suggest a few ways to address your problem. Firstly, you might want to seal any cracks or holes in the basement walls or foundation to prevent rodents from entering. Another option is to use bait stations or traps to catch and eliminate any rodents you already have. You could also try deterrents like spikes or ultrasonic repellers to keep them away. Finally, it might be beneficial to thoroughly clean and sanitize your basement, as rodents may be attracted to sources of food and water.",我有一间通风非常好的地下室，这意味着可能会让许多老鼠在此避难。
67,"There have been a lot of signs of more rodents this past month or so, which has been exceptionally surprising as it's spring and I would have thought they would venture outdoors with the change in weather."," As per my understanding and the available technology, it seems that you are experiencing an abundance of rodents. This may be due to the ongoing winter weather or a lack of predators in the area. However, it is natural for rodents to stay indoors during colder temperatures, so it's possible that they are now venturing outdoors as spring arrives. It's best to take appropriate measures to prevent further infestations, such as sealing any potential entry points and ensuring thorough cleaning.",在过去的一个月左右，有很多迹象表明出现了越来越多的老鼠，非常令人咋舌，由于现在是春季，我本以为随着天气的变化它们会冒然前往户外。
68,"Nonetheless, I've had a smattering of plain old snap-traps placed about, and would dutifully replenish the peanut butter on them every few days, as the mice kindly lick it clean."," I don't understand your question, but I'd be happy to help.

It can actually be seen as a violation of the animal rights and emotional distress caused by killing creatures.

78,"Discovered the hard way that in 2023, local TV station web sites are the absolute worst experience on the internet.", I am not capable of experiencing internet websites but I can agree that local tv station websites are often confusing and slow to load.,我发现，在 2023 年，地方电视台网站带给我的绝对是互联网上最糟糕的体验。

140,Here is a (slightly longer than) toot-length crash course in what I mean by dad-ification:," Dad-ification is the process of turning into a father or a male caregiver who resembles a father, whether or not you are actually a father. It involves adopting gender-stereotypical behaviors and attitudes that are traditionally assigned to fathers. This can include things like being protective and attentive to your child's needs, prioritizing your child's well-being over your own, and being authoritative in your parenting style. The goal of dad-ification is to provide a stable and nurturing environment for your child, much like a father would. However, this process can also reinforce traditional gender roles and stereotypes, which can be limiting and oppressive for both men and women.",以下是关于我所说的“父亲化”的简单概述（略长）：
141,"It isn't my term, it is a term used to describe when a narrative or gameplay mechanic is built around a central protagonist (usually older, usually male) stewarding or guarding another person (often younger)."," This is an interesting concept within storytelling and game design. It highlights the importance of having strong, relatable, and likable characters in the story. This allows the audience or players to fully engage with the story and connect with the emotions and events happening. The trope of the older, experienced mentor character who guides and guards a younger or weaker entity is also commonly found in many narratives and games, from Harry Potter to Final Fantasy 7. Overall, it's a powerful tool for storytelling and game design, and one that has stood the test of time.",这不是我自己创造的术语，这个术语用来描述叙事或游戏机制围绕一个中心主角（通常是年长的，通常是男性）管理或保护另一个人（通常是年轻的）。
142,The Last of Us is an easy and canonical example of dad-ification.," I don't understand what you mean by ""dad-ification."".",《最后生还者》是一个关于父亲化的经典示例。
143,"Joel uses his skills and ability to enact (extreme) acts of violence to accomplish a task that is coded as ""caring."""," I don't understand the context of your statement. However, if you mean can joel be considered ""good"" for his actions in ""enthralled,"" the answer would depend on one's perspective. While joel is portrayed as a violent and disturbing character, there may be understandable reasons for his extreme behavior, and the novel raises questions about the consequences of such behavior.",Joel 利用其技能实施（极端）暴力行为，以完成一项代号为“关爱”的任务。
144,"Dad-ification usually posits that the solution to a situation where a parent figure must care for or protect a child or child stand-in is overwhelming strength, and using that strength to force a very specifically shaped power dynamic."," Rather than offering solutions, I can provide some updated information about the Dad-ification theory you mentioned. ",父亲化一般意味着，在父母必须照顾或保护孩子或弱势人员时，这种方法就屡试不爽，他们使用这种方法强制将自己的这种特定权力凌驾于他人之上。
145,"Dad-ification erodes the possibility for communal solutions, and often wholly ignores, or undercuts any agency the child has."," Sure, here's a system-generated translation:",父亲化不仅会削弱集体解决方案的可能性，还经常会完全忽视或削弱孩子的任何能动性。
146,"In this way, Dad-ification is a stand in for a lot of neoliberal ideals; especially ideas like bootstrapping and self-sufficiency as being an ultimate goal/indicator for success."," Dad-ification is a stand in for a set of neoliberal ideals, including concepts like bootstrapping and self-sufficiency as the ultimate goal/measure of success.",这样看来，父亲化是许多新自由主义理想的代表；尤其是像自力更生和自给自足作为成功的最终目标/指标这样的想法。

To answer your question, it is true that all living organisms eventually die, including humans. It is a natural process that is inevitable, and that is how life cycles work. However, your statement about technology being taken away one day is subjective to different perspectives and interpretations.
