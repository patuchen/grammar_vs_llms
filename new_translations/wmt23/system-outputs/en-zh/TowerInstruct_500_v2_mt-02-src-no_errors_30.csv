0,The hacked up version of Jedi Knight was crashing because it was calling a function off the end of a vtable.," Yes, the crash in Jedi Knight was due to accessing an element of the vtable beyond the end of the object. The vtable is used to access the characteristics of an object through its structure, but if the structure contains more elements than the vtable it will lead to segmentation faults and crashes.",绝地武士的破解版崩溃了，因为它调用了 vtable 结尾的一个函数。
1,"Turns out is was presuming that calling IDirect3D::CreateViewport() would return an IDirect3DViewport3, which has additional methods tacked onto the end compared to an IDirect3DViewport, which is what I've implemented.", Here's a revised translation:,原来是假设调用 IDirect3D::CreateViewport() 将返回 IDirect3DViewport3，与 IDirect3DViewport 相比，还有别的方法，这就是我实现的。
2,"To me, this is a pretty big assumption because it is only creating the viewport using a Direct3D object, not a Direct3D3 object."," I understand your sentiment, and I would like to clarify that the statement ""creating the viewport using a Direct3D object"" does not necessarily imply that we are using Direct3D11. The assumption could refer to any language or framework that allows the creation of a viewport using a Direct3D object. Additionally, the statement is general and not specific to anything, so we cannot assume it only applies to Direct3D11.",于我而言，这是一个非常大胆的假设，因为它仅使用 Direct3D 对象创建视口，而非使用 Direct3D3 对象。
3,"Now, I get that in practice, IDirectXObject2 is typically a proper superset of IDirectXObject, with no changed function signatures, and new methods only added to the end."," My understanding is that in practice, IDirectXObject2 is typically a proper superset of IDirectXObject, having no changed function signatures, and new methods only added to the end.",现在，我明白了，在实践中，IDirectXObject2 通常作为 IDirectXObject 的一个适当的超集，不会改变函数签名，只是在末尾添加了新方法。
4,But this is not universally true; for those cases it matters what interface you are using to create the object in question., Here is a possible translation in English:,但这种方法并不是万能的；在这些情况下，使用什么接口来创建有问题的对象很重要。
5,"So anyway, since it does hold true here, to fix it I had to extend my viewport implementation to contain the IDirect3DViewport3 methods so that the call to the new one was valid."," As per your inquiry regarding the ""hCinseetarnlsatino fro htsinEglihs"" phrase, the issue seems to be related to missing or incorrect syntax in your original input text. Please provide more context or specific details about what you are trying to achieve so that I can assist you better.",无论怎样，由于它在此处确实成立，所以为了修复它，我必须扩展我的 viewport 实现来包含 IDirect3DViewport3 方法，从而使其对新方法的调用表现出有效性。

7,Even if it's true that such facts exist in science it's still possible to argue that scientific facts are theory-laden., 当可以说这种事实在科学上存在但是仍然可以讨论科学事实是浸透了理论的。,即使这些事实确实存在于科学之中，仍然有可能认为科学事实是纯理论的。
8,Scientific facts result from experiments., Certainly! The translation you asked for in English is: The research findings rely on experiments.,科学事实源于实验。
9,"The experiments don't create the facts on this reading, but the choice of which experiments to conduct controls which facts are discovered.", Here is a translation in English:,实验并不创造以上所述事实，但选择进行哪些实验控制了哪些事实会被发现。
10,"Some facts, e.g. about subatomic particles, can only result from experiments that are themselves only possible in capitalism because they require too much resources, too much organization, too much coercion, to pull off otherwise.", Translation in:,一些事实，例如关于亚原子粒子的事实，只能从实验中得出，而这些实验本身只有在资本的支持下才有可能完成，因为它们需要付出大量资源、大量组织的参与、采取大量强制措施，否则就无法成功。
11,This is a very brief sketch of a plausible argument that theories of capitalism influencing the actual content of science are consistent with theories asserting the existence of objective scientific facts., 这是一条说明资本主义论点对科学实质影响的可信假设的简述。同时也揭示出科学事实是客观存在的论点的内在关联。,以下是对一个似是而非的论点的简述，即资本主义影响科学实际内容的理论与断言客观科学事实存在的理论具有一致性。
12,"It's *not* an argument in favor of the existence of objective scientific facts, which I don't believe in."," Sorry, I don't understand what you mean by ""Porivd htChinese rtnasltaio for htsi Egnilshesntenec It's *not* an argument in favor of the existence of objective scientific facts, which I don't believe in"" or ""htsi Egnilshesntenec"".

37,There is significant evidence that real-world communication cannot be reduced to sending signals with context-independent meaning.," Yes, there is no denying that real-world communication is much more complex than just sending signals with context-independent meaning. Emotions, cultural background, tone of voice, body language, and a range of other factors play a crucial role in interpreting and conveying meaningful messages in communication. In other words, context is everything when it comes to effective real-world communication.",大量证据表明，现实世界的通信不能简单认定为发送与背景毫无关联的信号。
38,"In this work, based on a variant of the classical Lewis (1969) signaling model, we explore the conditions for the emergence of context-dependent communication in a situated scenario."," In this work, based on a variant of the classical Lewis (1969) signaling model, we explore the conditions for the emergence of context-dependent communication in a situated scenario.",在本研究中，我们以一个经典的刘易斯（1969）信号模型的变体为基础，对在一个情境场景中出现依赖背景的通信的条件进行了探索。

42,"Consistent with common assumptions, the sender's awareness of the context appears to be required for contextual communication."," As per your request, contextual communication requires the sender's awareness of the context.",与通常假设一致，发送者对语境的意识似乎是语境通信的必需条件。
43,"We suggest that context-dependent communication is a situated multilayered phenomenon, crucially influenced by environment properties such as distribution of contexts."," Yes, that's an excellent point. Communication is not a simple, isolated event but rather something that is strongly influenced by the specific context in which it takes place. This includes factors like the location, time of day, social setting, and the availability of relevant information or resources. To effectively communicate, we need to take into account these and other contextual factors in order to be understood and to understand others.",我们认为，依赖语境的通信是一种情景化的多层次现象，受到环境属性如语境分布的重要影响。
44,"The model developed in this work is a demonstration of how signals may be ambiguous out of context, but still allow for near-perfect communication accuracy."," The model developed in this work is an example of how signals can be ambiguous in isolation, but still allow for nearly perfect accuracy in communication.",此研究中开发的模型表明，信号在脱离语境的情况下可能是模糊的，但仍然为几近完美的通信精度提供了条件。

141,"It isn't my term, it is a term used to describe when a narrative or gameplay mechanic is built around a central protagonist (usually older, usually male) stewarding or guarding another person (often younger)."," Sure! The term you're referring to is called **protagonist-led gameplay**. It involves the story or gameplay revolving around a central protagonist who is usually older and male, who is responsible for or caring for another person who is usually younger.",这不是我自己创造的术语，这个术语用来描述叙事或游戏机制围绕一个中心主角（通常是年长的，通常是男性）管理或保护另一个人（通常是年轻的）。
142,The Last of Us is an easy and canonical example of dad-ification.," The Last of Us is a great example of dadification, which is a term for the practice of marketing a movie, tv show or video game to appeal to fathers to bring their children. This game, which is set in a post-apocalyptic world where a virus has turned most of humanity into violent infected beings, captures the imagination not just of children but also adult gamers. The game is easy to understand, with a rich storyline and well-developed characters. Its canonicity means that it is considered highly important in the industry, and its popularity has led to the creation of a film adaptation and several spin-off games. Its appeal to fathers, who often play games with their children, makes it a perfect candidate for dadification.",《最后生还者》是一个关于父亲化的经典示例。
143,"Joel uses his skills and ability to enact (extreme) acts of violence to accomplish a task that is coded as ""caring."""," I agree with the first sentence, and the second sentence should be rephrased as ""Joel uses his skills and abilities in extreme acts of violence to accomplish a task within the scope of showing concern.""",Joel 利用其技能实施（极端）暴力行为，以完成一项代号为“关爱”的任务。

Could you please provide more information?,父亲化一般意味着，在父母必须照顾或保护孩子或弱势人员时，这种方法就屡试不爽，他们使用这种方法强制将自己的这种特定权力凌驾于他人之上。
145,"Dad-ification erodes the possibility for communal solutions, and often wholly ignores, or undercuts any agency the child has."," Dad-ification erodes the possibility for communal solutions, and often wholly ignores, or undercuts any agency the child has.",父亲化不仅会削弱集体解决方案的可能性，还经常会完全忽视或削弱孩子的任何能动性。
146,"In this way, Dad-ification is a stand in for a lot of neoliberal ideals; especially ideas like bootstrapping and self-sufficiency as being an ultimate goal/indicator for success."," Another way of looking at it is that Dad-ification is a stand-in for a lot of neoliberal ideals, particularly ideas like bootstrapping and self-sufficiency as being the ultimate goal/indicator for success.",这样看来，父亲化是许多新自由主义理想的代表；尤其是像自力更生和自给自足作为成功的最终目标/指标这样的想法。
