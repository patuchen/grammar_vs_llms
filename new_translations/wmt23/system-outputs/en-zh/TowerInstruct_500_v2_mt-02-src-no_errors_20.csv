0,The hacked up version of Jedi Knight was crashing because it was calling a function off the end of a vtable.," Yes, I can help you translate that sentence in Chinese.",绝地武士的破解版崩溃了，因为它调用了 vtable 结尾的一个函数。
1,"Turns out is was presuming that calling IDirect3D::CreateViewport() would return an IDirect3DViewport3, which has additional methods tacked onto the end compared to an IDirect3DViewport, which is what I've implemented.", Here is a Chinese translation:,原来是假设调用 IDirect3D::CreateViewport() 将返回 IDirect3DViewport3，与 IDirect3DViewport 相比，还有别的方法，这就是我实现的。
2,"To me, this is a pretty big assumption because it is only creating the viewport using a Direct3D object, not a Direct3D3 object."," A possible translation in Cihnees of the phrase ""To me, this is a pretty big assumption because it is only creating the viewport using a Direct3D object, not a Direct3D3 object."" is:",于我而言，这是一个非常大胆的假设，因为它仅使用 Direct3D 对象创建视口，而非使用 Direct3D3 对象。

4,But this is not universally true; for those cases it matters what interface you are using to create the object in question.," These sentences show a kind of symmetry between two languages, and so they can be helpful in making systems bilingual. However, there are many different kinds of sentences and many different contexts in which language is used. In general, if you are trying to create a system that can translate between two languages, it is essential to have a large corpus of translated text to train the machine learning algorithms that will drive the translation. This often involves manually marking up large volumes of translated text to indicate where there are differences in meaning or style between the original source language and the target language.\n ",但这种方法并不是万能的；在这些情况下，使用什么接口来创建有问题的对象很重要。
5,"So anyway, since it does hold true here, to fix it I had to extend my viewport implementation to contain the IDirect3DViewport3 methods so that the call to the new one was valid."," As per your request, the translation of the former English sentence is as follows: Anyway, since it applies in this case, in order to resolve the problem, I had to extend my implementation of the viewport to include the IDirect3DViewport3 methods, so that the call to the new one would be valid.\n",无论怎样，由于它在此处确实成立，所以为了修复它，我必须扩展我的 viewport 实现来包含 IDirect3DViewport3 方法，从而使其对新方法的调用表现出有效性。

139,I gripe about dad-ification a lot., Translation provided:,我多父亲化这种行为非常抵制。
140,Here is a (slightly longer than) toot-length crash course in what I mean by dad-ification:," Dad-ification: the process in which modern-day fathers attempt to raise their children with their own brand of humor, absurdity, and video game/sports references. This often involves funny catchphrases, impersonating cartoon characters, and engaging in mock battles or races using pillows or stuffed animals as weapons. As a result, children are often exposed to the comedic worldview of men who are on the younger side of middle-aged, creating a warped view of masculinity that emphasizes sarcasm and screwing around. While this may seem harmless or even endearing, the long-term effects of dad-ifying children include a lack of empathy, emotional detachment, and difficulty forming healthy relationships with others.",以下是关于我所说的“父亲化”的简单概述（略长）：
141,"It isn't my term, it is a term used to describe when a narrative or gameplay mechanic is built around a central protagonist (usually older, usually male) stewarding or guarding another person (often younger)."," As requested, the Chinese translation for the English sentence: It's not my term, it's a term used to describe when a narrative or gameplay mechanic is built around a central protagonist (usually older, usually male) stewarding or guarding another person (often younger).",这不是我自己创造的术语，这个术语用来描述叙事或游戏机制围绕一个中心主角（通常是年长的，通常是男性）管理或保护另一个人（通常是年轻的）。
142,The Last of Us is an easy and canonical example of dad-ification.," ""The Last of Us is a straightforward and canonical example of dadification.""",《最后生还者》是一个关于父亲化的经典示例。
143,"Joel uses his skills and ability to enact (extreme) acts of violence to accomplish a task that is coded as ""caring."""," Joel uses his skills and ability to perform (extreme) acts of violence to fulfill a task that is coded as ""caring.""",Joel 利用其技能实施（极端）暴力行为，以完成一项代号为“关爱”的任务。
144,"Dad-ification usually posits that the solution to a situation where a parent figure must care for or protect a child or child stand-in is overwhelming strength, and using that strength to force a very specifically shaped power dynamic."," Dad-ification usually involves the idea that the solution to a situation where a parent figure must care for or protect a child or child stand-in is all-consuming strength, and using that strength to instill a very specific power dynamic.",父亲化一般意味着，在父母必须照顾或保护孩子或弱势人员时，这种方法就屡试不爽，他们使用这种方法强制将自己的这种特定权力凌驾于他人之上。
145,"Dad-ification erodes the possibility for communal solutions, and often wholly ignores, or undercuts any agency the child has."," 维护联想翻译为:由于人性化管理削弱了社群解决的可能性,往往无视或削弱儿童的自主权。",父亲化不仅会削弱集体解决方案的可能性，还经常会完全忽视或削弱孩子的任何能动性。
146,"In this way, Dad-ification is a stand in for a lot of neoliberal ideals; especially ideas like bootstrapping and self-sufficiency as being an ultimate goal/indicator for success."," Dad-ification represents a lot of neoliberal ideals, particularly the values of self-reliance and self-sufficiency that are considered ultimate goals and indicators of success.",这样看来，父亲化是许多新自由主义理想的代表；尤其是像自力更生和自给自足作为成功的最终目标/指标这样的想法。
