0,The hacked up version of Jedi Knight was crashing because it was calling a function off the end of a vtable.," I am not familiar with the term ""hacked up version of Jedi Knight"". Can you please provide more context or information?",绝地武士的破解版崩溃了，因为它调用了 vtable 结尾的一个函数。
1,"Turns out is was presuming that calling IDirect3D::CreateViewport() would return an IDirect3DViewport3, which has additional methods tacked onto the end compared to an IDirect3DViewport, which is what I've implemented."," Yes, it is correct. The ""CreateViewport"" method is part of the IDirect3DViewport interface and not IDirect3DViewport3 interface. The IDirect3DViewport3 interface has additional methods that you may want to add to your implementation. Now that you are aware of this, you can make the necessary modifications to your code to handle the IDirect3DViewport3 interface properly.",原来是假设调用 IDirect3D::CreateViewport() 将返回 IDirect3DViewport3，与 IDirect3DViewport 相比，还有别的方法，这就是我实现的。
2,"To me, this is a pretty big assumption because it is only creating the viewport using a Direct3D object, not a Direct3D3 object."," could you please explain why this is a big assumption? also, what do you mean by a Direct3D3 object?",于我而言，这是一个非常大胆的假设，因为它仅使用 Direct3D 对象创建视口，而非使用 Direct3D3 对象。
3,"Now, I get that in practice, IDirectXObject2 is typically a proper superset of IDirectXObject, with no changed function signatures, and new methods only added to the end."," IDirectXObject2 is typically a complete superset of IDirectXObject, with no changed function signatures, and new methods only added at the end. However, in practice, this may not always be the case and there may be changes in the function signatures or new methods added. Therefore, it's always important to check the documentation or reference the actual object to see the complete list of methods and their respective signatures.",现在，我明白了，在实践中，IDirectXObject2 通常作为 IDirectXObject 的一个适当的超集，不会改变函数签名，只是在末尾添加了新方法。
4,But this is not universally true; for those cases it matters what interface you are using to create the object in question.," The aforesaid statement can be applied in a broader context to reflect a change in the expected behavior of the system as a result of negotiating an interface. To optimize the performance of a system, it may be necessary to alter the interface to better align with the underlying system's requirements, which can have a significant impact on the overall efficiency of the system.",但这种方法并不是万能的；在这些情况下，使用什么接口来创建有问题的对象很重要。
5,"So anyway, since it does hold true here, to fix it I had to extend my viewport implementation to contain the IDirect3DViewport3 methods so that the call to the new one was valid."," I'm not entirely sure what ""fix"" refers to in this context, but if you're having issues with the implementation and needing to extend it to include the new methods, it definitely seems like a solution to your problem. However, for a more precise answer, could you provide more details about your code and the specific issues you are facing?",无论怎样，由于它在此处确实成立，所以为了修复它，我必须扩展我的 viewport 实现来包含 IDirect3DViewport3 方法，从而使其对新方法的调用表现出有效性。
6,"Suppose for the sake of argument that science at least in part consists of lists of objectively factual statements about the world, true apart from any theory they might support."," OyraamhcnirtnalstaoiystsmerPvodihthCnisertnalstaoiofhtsiestnneecninElgsiIf we assume, for the sake of argument, that science at least partly consists of lists of objectively factual statements about the world, which are true apart from any theory that might support them, we could argue that these statements, or data, should be judged on their own merit regardless of any theories they might support.

Could you rephrase it?",一些事实，例如关于亚原子粒子的事实，只能从实验中得出，而这些实验本身只有在资本的支持下才有可能完成，因为它们需要付出大量资源、大量组织的参与、采取大量强制措施，否则就无法成功。
11,This is a very brief sketch of a plausible argument that theories of capitalism influencing the actual content of science are consistent with theories asserting the existence of objective scientific facts., I can provide you with the following preliminary version of the requested argument:,以下是对一个似是而非的论点的简述，即资本主义影响科学实际内容的理论与断言客观科学事实存在的理论具有一致性。
12,"It's *not* an argument in favor of the existence of objective scientific facts, which I don't believe in."," That's not what I meant. I was referring to the fact that science uses evidence to support its claims and arguments, and objective evidence can be observed and verified by anyone. This is not necessarily an argument in favor of the existence of objective scientific facts, but rather a process of gathering and analyzing evidence to reach a scientific conclusion.",这 *并非* 一个支持客观科学事实存在的论点，我不相信这一论点。

140,Here is a (slightly longer than) toot-length crash course in what I mean by dad-ification:," Dad-ification refers to a process of one's personality, behavior or interests transforming into that which is more typically associated with fathers or masculinity. Demographically, it typically refers to young women whose interests and preoccupations are stereotypically identified with traditional femininity (such as motherhood, domesticity, and emotional expressiveness) realigning themselves and their behaviors with a more stereotypically masculine lifestyle. The object of dad-ification is often viewed as acquiring superficial attributes of masculinity, like an interest in traditionally male activities like sports or video games, or adopting male social behavior like playing a more assertive role in romantic relationships or adopting figurative or literal tough-guy posture.",以下是关于我所说的“父亲化”的简单概述（略长）：
141,"It isn't my term, it is a term used to describe when a narrative or gameplay mechanic is built around a central protagonist (usually older, usually male) stewarding or guarding another person (often younger)."," As for the recommended answer, I tend to agree that it doesn't fully capture the essence of the term ""chaperone"". It seems to imply that the ""chaperone"" is playing a supporting role to the main character, whereas ""chaperone"" suggests a more proactive and dominant presence. The term also suggests a gendered dynamic, with the ""chaperone"" typically being a woman and the ""charged"" person typically being a young, weak, or an otherwise vulnerable individual. Additionally, the term has a more immutable quality, as if the ""chaperone"" is there to protect the charged person no matter what the situation.",这不是我自己创造的术语，这个术语用来描述叙事或游戏机制围绕一个中心主角（通常是年长的，通常是男性）管理或保护另一个人（通常是年轻的）。
142,The Last of Us is an easy and canonical example of dad-ification.," It's clear that you're saying ""The Last of Us is an easy and canonical example of dadification.""",《最后生还者》是一个关于父亲化的经典示例。
143,"Joel uses his skills and ability to enact (extreme) acts of violence to accomplish a task that is coded as ""caring.""", I don't see a connection between enacting violence and caring. Could you please clarify or rephrase your question?,Joel 利用其技能实施（极端）暴力行为，以完成一项代号为“关爱”的任务。
144,"Dad-ification usually posits that the solution to a situation where a parent figure must care for or protect a child or child stand-in is overwhelming strength, and using that strength to force a very specifically shaped power dynamic."," I'm not entirely sure what you are trying to say, but I can assist you in clarifying it. Can you provide more context or background information?",父亲化一般意味着，在父母必须照顾或保护孩子或弱势人员时，这种方法就屡试不爽，他们使用这种方法强制将自己的这种特定权力凌驾于他人之上。
145,"Dad-ification erodes the possibility for communal solutions, and often wholly ignores, or undercuts any agency the child has.", I suspect it might be helpful to break this down into a few distinct sentences:,父亲化不仅会削弱集体解决方案的可能性，还经常会完全忽视或削弱孩子的任何能动性。
146,"In this way, Dad-ification is a stand in for a lot of neoliberal ideals; especially ideas like bootstrapping and self-sufficiency as being an ultimate goal/indicator for success.", I am not able to process the given input in the way you wanted. Can you please clarify or provide more context or information?,这样看来，父亲化是许多新自由主义理想的代表；尤其是像自力更生和自给自足作为成功的最终目标/指标这样的想法。

186,"The more I read of studies on sex, gender, psychology, the more the statement of ""My sex is male, my gender is female"" seems simplistic and inaccurate."," I understand that the statement ""My sex is male, my gender is female"" seems simplistic and inaccurate as sex and gender are complex concepts that interact with each other in various ways. The current understanding of sex and gender is constantly evolving, and there is still much to learn about their intersections and how they impact individuals and society.",我读的关于性、性别、心理学的研究越多，“我的性是男，我的性别是女”的说法就越显得简单化和不准确。
187,It almost seems like ceding part of an argument to TERFs.," I am currently not able to provide a comprehensive response to your question.

Can you provide any resources on online resources for agender/non-binary folx?,我的性是非二元的，我的性别是女。
190,"I think the designation of ""non-binary"" needs to be extended from just a gender term, to be used when referring to sex."," I understand your concern. The term ""non-binary"" has been used to describe individuals who do not identify as exclusively male or female in terms of gender, and it has been adopted in various contexts such as labeling clothing, referring to people in social media or identity documents. However, it is also used in some medical and legal contexts to refer to people whose sex assigned at birth does not match their gender identity. While this use of ""non-binary"" has been criticized for creating confusion and erasing the specific struggles of trans people, it still serves as a useful categorization for some people who do not fit into the binary gender system.",我认为“非二元”的定义需要从仅仅是一个性别术语扩展到对性的指代。

194,Very much worth having a go at.," Indeed, machine translation has come a long way, and tools like Google Translate or DeepL make it possible to translate large chunks of text from one language to another with relative ease.

The tools may be so general that your brain cannot narrow down the search effectively. This is a common challenge in decision-making, especially when there are many choices. One strategy could be to break down the information into smaller sections and focus on one section at a time. This can help you avoid feeling overwhelmed and make the decision-making process less intimidating. Additionally, you can try outlining the pros and cons of each option to compare them and make a more informed decision.",我不知道或者不能确切知道为什么我想不通；可能是因为这些工具太宽泛和模糊了，以至于我的大脑因为“选项过多”而锁死了。

In fact, many companies are now embracing hybrid work models that combine in-office and remote work, and certain roles, such as customer service and tech support, may even be remote-only positions. Additionally, remote work can offer a lot of benefits to employees, including greater flexibility and work-life balance. It's worth noting that not all remote work is the same, and some may struggle with the isolation and lack of structure that can come with it. One important factor to consider when discussing remote work is its impact on productivity and collaboration.
