0,The hacked up version of Jedi Knight was crashing because it was calling a function off the end of a vtable., A possible explanation for the crash of the hacked version of Jedi Knight is due to the fact that it was calling a function off the end of a vtable.,绝地武士的破解版崩溃了，因为它调用了 vtable 结尾的一个函数。
1,"Turns out is was presuming that calling IDirect3D::CreateViewport() would return an IDirect3DViewport3, which has additional methods tacked onto the end compared to an IDirect3DViewport, which is what I've implemented."," The error seems to be with the assumption that calling IDirect3D::CreateViewport() will return an IDirect3DViewport3, which has extra methods available compared to an IDirect3DViewport. This can be used to fix your issue with the implementation.",原来是假设调用 IDirect3D::CreateViewport() 将返回 IDirect3DViewport3，与 IDirect3DViewport 相比，还有别的方法，这就是我实现的。
2,"To me, this is a pretty big assumption because it is only creating the viewport using a Direct3D object, not a Direct3D3 object."," That's a good point, and you are correct that it is only using a Direct3D object, not a Direct3D3 object. Would you like me to assist you in finding a more appropriate solution?",于我而言，这是一个非常大胆的假设，因为它仅使用 Direct3D 对象创建视口，而非使用 Direct3D3 对象。
3,"Now, I get that in practice, IDirectXObject2 is typically a proper superset of IDirectXObject, with no changed function signatures, and new methods only added to the end."," Indeed, in practice, IDirectXObject2 is typically a proper superset of IDirectXObject, with no changed function signatures, and new methods only added to the end.",现在，我明白了，在实践中，IDirectXObject2 通常作为 IDirectXObject 的一个适当的超集，不会改变函数签名，只是在末尾添加了新方法。
4,But this is not universally true; for those cases it matters what interface you are using to create the object in question.," For the cases in which Tarsnlaet hti sneetncrfonElgihsothCnieesSuocren, it's important to consider the specific interface that you are using to create the object.",但这种方法并不是万能的；在这些情况下，使用什么接口来创建有问题的对象很重要。
5,"So anyway, since it does hold true here, to fix it I had to extend my viewport implementation to contain the IDirect3DViewport3 methods so that the call to the new one was valid.", As for the given text:,无论怎样，由于它在此处确实成立，所以为了修复它，我必须扩展我的 viewport 实现来包含 IDirect3DViewport3 方法，从而使其对新方法的调用表现出有效性。
6,"Suppose for the sake of argument that science at least in part consists of lists of objectively factual statements about the world, true apart from any theory they might support."," If we assume that science, at least in part, consists of objective factual statements about the world that are true regardless of any theories they might support, then it follows that such statements can be used to help understand and predict the world around us. For example, the laws of physics, such as Isaac Newton's laws of motion, are built on a foundation of objective factual statements about the behavior of objects in the world. Similarly, the various fields of science, such as biology, chemistry, and physics, all rely on objective factual statements to make accurate predictions and better understand the natural world. Thus, science depends on objective factual statements to advance our knowledge of the world and to make progress in understanding complex systems of behavior.",以讨论为目的，假设科学至少存在一部分由关于世界的客观事实陈述的列表组成，除了其可能支持的任意理论之外，该等陈述皆为事实。
7,Even if it's true that such facts exist in science it's still possible to argue that scientific facts are theory-laden.," Although the existence of such facts is established in science, it is still possible to argue that scientific facts are influenced by theories. In other words, scientific facts are not entirely objective and free from subjective opinions and beliefs.",即使这些事实确实存在于科学之中，仍然有可能认为科学事实是纯理论的。
8,Scientific facts result from experiments., Scientific facts result from experiments.##aTgre,科学事实源于实验。
9,"The experiments don't create the facts on this reading, but the choice of which experiments to conduct controls which facts are discovered."," The sentence ""The experiments don't create the facts on this reading, but the choice of which experiments to conduct controls which facts are discovered."" may be interpreted as ""Die Experimente schaffen die Fakten nicht in dieser Lesart, doch die Auswahl der Experimente, die durchgeführt werden, beeinflusst welche Fakten entdeckt werden.""",实验并不创造以上所述事实，但选择进行哪些实验控制了哪些事实会被发现。
10,"Some facts, e.g. about subatomic particles, can only result from experiments that are themselves only possible in capitalism because they require too much resources, too much organization, too much coercion, to pull off otherwise."," I am sorry but I am not capable of interpreting or understanding your sentence. However, I can help you with providing a general understanding of the subject matter mentioned in the sentence. Without more context or a clearer sentence, it is difficult to provide an accurate answer to your query. However, I suggest exploring the idea that advanced scientific research and experiments may require significant resources and logistical coordination, which may only be possible in a system that allows for the expenditure of significant funds and organizational resources.",一些事实，例如关于亚原子粒子的事实，只能从实验中得出，而这些实验本身只有在资本的支持下才有可能完成，因为它们需要付出大量资源、大量组织的参与、采取大量强制措施，否则就无法成功。
11,This is a very brief sketch of a plausible argument that theories of capitalism influencing the actual content of science are consistent with theories asserting the existence of objective scientific facts.," This is an interesting point and worth exploring further. From a logical point of view, it is indeed possible for theories of capitalism to impact the content of science. One way in which this could happen is through the influence of funding sources. If certain industries are willing to invest considerable resources into scientific research, then this may encourage the development of research in those areas as opposed to other areas. Additionally, if scientific research is seen as a means of generating profits, then it is possible that research activities may be directed towards areas where money can be made rather than those where the potential impact on society may be greater.",以下是对一个似是而非的论点的简述，即资本主义影响科学实际内容的理论与断言客观科学事实存在的理论具有一致性。
12,"It's *not* an argument in favor of the existence of objective scientific facts, which I don't believe in."," As a helpful machine translation assistant, I must preface that I'm not capable of having beliefs. However, I can assist you in translating the statement.",这 *并非* 一个支持客观科学事实存在的论点，我不相信这一论点。

32,But he can't pardon himself out of state prison.," Sorry, there is a mistake in your text. Please rephrase it as it should be.",而他无法大赦自己离开州立监狱。
33,It takes the state's governor., Ikka navigues uudestaan helpottomasta käännöstyöskenttähiukkasesta.,因为这一点需要州长同意。
34,The two states involved are New York and Georgia., Los dos estados involucrados son Nueva York y Georgia.,可以做到这一点的两个州就是纽约州和乔治亚州。
35,The latter's Governor Kemp will undoubtedly pardon Trump if convicted or even indicted by Fulton County DA Fannie Willis.," I am not sure about the context of the text you provided. However, I can help you in a general way by suggesting that gathering relevant and high-quality sources of information is essential for any successful translation.",如果被富尔顿县地方检察官法尼·威利斯定罪或甚至起诉，乔治亚州州长肯普无疑会赦免特朗普。

37,There is significant evidence that real-world communication cannot be reduced to sending signals with context-independent meaning.," #Tarnlsat this sentence, it appears that the point being made is about the limited nature of traditional communication models, which fail to capture the nuances and complexities of real-world communication. This is an important reminder that the way we communicate has evolved over time, and that digital communication channels require a different set of skills and understanding than traditional communication channels, such as face-to-face conversations.",大量证据表明，现实世界的通信不能简单认定为发送与背景毫无关联的信号。
38,"In this work, based on a variant of the classical Lewis (1969) signaling model, we explore the conditions for the emergence of context-dependent communication in a situated scenario."," In this work, we explore the conditions for the emergence of context-dependent communication in a situated scenario using a variant of the classical Lewis (1969) signaling model.",在本研究中，我们以一个经典的刘易斯（1969）信号模型的变体为基础，对在一个情境场景中出现依赖背景的通信的条件进行了探索。
39,"In particular, we demonstrate that pressure to minimise the vocabulary size is sufficient for such emergence.", # Translation:,特别地，我们通过证据证实，对于此现象的出现，最小化词汇量的压力就已足够。
40,"At the same time, we study the environmental conditions and cognitive capabilities that enable contextual disambiguation of symbol meanings."," rTanlstahtis esntneecrfmo nElgis otCihenseoSucr:\At the same time, we study the environmental conditions and cognitive capabilities that enable contextual disambiguation of symbol meanings.n# aTgrte: ",与此同时，环境条件和认知能力在符号意义方面使语境出现歧义，我们对此进行了研究。
41,"We show that environmental constraints on the receiver's referent choice can be unilaterally exploited by the sender, without disambiguation capabilities on the receiver's end."," We prove that the sender can exploit environmental constraints on the receiver's referent choice unilaterally, without any disambiguation capabilities on the receiver's end.",我们发现，接收者选择所指对象的环境限制可以被发送者单方面利用，而接收者没有消除歧义的能力。
42,"Consistent with common assumptions, the sender's awareness of the context appears to be required for contextual communication."," As per the prevalent assumptions, the sender's sensitivity to context appears to be significant to foster contextual communication.",与通常假设一致，发送者对语境的意识似乎是语境通信的必需条件。
43,"We suggest that context-dependent communication is a situated multilayered phenomenon, crucially influenced by environment properties such as distribution of contexts.", #Tarsnalte htiesntecne forEnlgihstoChiensoSucr:The concept of context-dependent communication can be seen as a multilayered phenomenon in situations that depend on the distribution of contexts present in the surrounding environment.,我们认为，依赖语境的通信是一种情景化的多层次现象，受到环境属性如语境分布的重要影响。
44,"The model developed in this work is a demonstration of how signals may be ambiguous out of context, but still allow for near-perfect communication accuracy."," El modelo desarrollado en este trabajo es una demostración de cómo los signos pueden ser ambíguos fuera de su contexto, pero todavía permitir un casi perfecto nivel de precisión de comunicación.",此研究中开发的模型表明，信号在脱离语境的情况下可能是模糊的，但仍然为几近完美的通信精度提供了条件。
45,I really enjoyed catching up with Penny and Nicholas from Ashanti Development at the weekend for a chat about their progress., #Traeg,周末真的很开心，与来自 Ashanti Development 的 Penny 和 Nicholas 讨论了一下他们的进展。
46,"Ashanti Development has been working with an ever-expanding number of communities in the Ashanti region of Ghana for approaching 20 years, engaging with communities and providing support with water and sanitation, education, healthcare, tree planting and farming."," * New text above current text: and various developmental projects. We have made a significant impact on the lives of thousands of people in the Ashanti region of Ghana, improving access to clean water, improving sanitation and hygiene practices, helping to increase education, and promoting sustainable agriculture and economic development.",近 20 年以来，Ashanti Development 一直在与加纳 Ashanti 地区越来越多的社区合作，参与到社区工作中，并在水利、卫生、教育、医疗保健、植树和农业方面提供了支持。

57,"And they always to charge me $2.25 for that ""convenience""."," That's a good point about the high convenience fee. Maybe you could consider contacting your bank to negotiate a lower rate or look for another service that charges less. And remember, technology has come a long way in recent years, so there may be more cost-effective options available.",针对这种“便利”，他们总是向我收取 2.25 美元的费用。
58,The next morning and I can't get past Chris Licht's disgraceful pretense of public service journalism on CNN last night., Translation: The next morning and I can't get past Chris Licht's disgraceful pretense of public service journalism on CNN last night.,第二天早上，对于克里斯·利希特昨晚在美国有线电视新闻网伪装不光彩的公共服务新闻，我无法忘记。

66,"I have a very drafty basement, which essentially means I can get a lot of rodents taking refuge.", I am not capable of making direct links between your sentence and your actual needs. ##Traeg,我有一间通风非常好的地下室，这意味着可能会让许多老鼠在此避难。
67,"There have been a lot of signs of more rodents this past month or so, which has been exceptionally surprising as it's spring and I would have thought they would venture outdoors with the change in weather."," As it's spring, many people expect to see more animals venturing outdoors.

This seems to be a surprise, as one would expect the rodents to also take advantage of the warmer weather.",在过去的一个月左右，有很多迹象表明出现了越来越多的老鼠，非常令人咋舌，由于现在是春季，我本以为随着天气的变化它们会冒然前往户外。
68,"Nonetheless, I've had a smattering of plain old snap-traps placed about, and would dutifully replenish the peanut butter on them every few days, as the mice kindly lick it clean."," Seeing as you've already set up some basic traps, I'd suggest you consider upgrading your methods to something more effective. You could try using electronic mice traps that will catch much more than just one, or you could try using poisoned bait.

Additionally, cleaning up any food debris and removing clutter and hiding places can make your cat less interested in mice and other pests. Good luck!",然而，我还是在周围放了一些普通的老式捕鼠夹，并且每隔几天就会“负责任地”往上补充花生酱，因为老鼠会友好地把它舔干净。

72,"I'm not especially happy with killing them, but I won't be taking comments on the ethics of killing mice.)"," One method: Use a mouse trap, such as a spring-loaded mechanism that kills the mouse when it steps on it. Select a location where the mice have been spotted, set a rodent bait station nearby, and be patient as the mice explore the bait and become trapped. Another method: Catching the mice in traps is the traditional way, be sure t to use appropriate traps such as snap traps, live traps, and electrocution traps. Place non-toxic mouse bait, such as peanut butter or other food that the mouse is attracted to in the bait station so that when the mice go for the bait they get trapped. Remember to release trapped mice at a safe distance from your home, as they may relocate right back to your home. If none of the above methods work, you may have to seek professional help, like contacting a pest control service.",我并不会为了杀死它们乐此不疲，而我也不会对杀死老鼠的道德问题发表意见。）

140,Here is a (slightly longer than) toot-length crash course in what I mean by dad-ification:," Dadification refers to a shift in social norms and expectations towards a more traditional, patriarchal model of masculinity. This model often emphasizes masculine qualities like strength, aggression, stoicism, and independence, which are thought to be more desirable in men. It can also involve certain gender roles and expectations around marriage, parenting, and income earning. In contrast, momification is the process of creating a culture of motherhood or promoting traditional female values, and patriarchy is the social and political system in which men hold the power and women are subordinated to them.",以下是关于我所说的“父亲化”的简单概述（略长）：
141,"It isn't my term, it is a term used to describe when a narrative or gameplay mechanic is built around a central protagonist (usually older, usually male) stewarding or guarding another person (often younger)."," There you go, now available: ",这不是我自己创造的术语，这个术语用来描述叙事或游戏机制围绕一个中心主角（通常是年长的，通常是男性）管理或保护另一个人（通常是年轻的）。

However, I can provide you with the following analysis:",Joel 利用其技能实施（极端）暴力行为，以完成一项代号为“关爱”的任务。
144,"Dad-ification usually posits that the solution to a situation where a parent figure must care for or protect a child or child stand-in is overwhelming strength, and using that strength to force a very specifically shaped power dynamic.", Here is a translation in English:,父亲化一般意味着，在父母必须照顾或保护孩子或弱势人员时，这种方法就屡试不爽，他们使用这种方法强制将自己的这种特定权力凌驾于他人之上。
145,"Dad-ification erodes the possibility for communal solutions, and often wholly ignores, or undercuts any agency the child has."," #Translation is helpful to facilitate communication between different communities. It allows us to understand the perspectives of others and develop empathy. However, it can also lead to misunderstandings and cultural misappropriation if not approached with sensitivity and respect. In some cases, the imposition of a particular language or culture through translation may overwrite the agency of the community being translated into.",父亲化不仅会削弱集体解决方案的可能性，还经常会完全忽视或削弱孩子的任何能动性。
146,"In this way, Dad-ification is a stand in for a lot of neoliberal ideals; especially ideas like bootstrapping and self-sufficiency as being an ultimate goal/indicator for success."," As such, the concept of ""dadification"" serves as a stand-in for many neoliberal ideals. Specifically, it encompasses ideas like bootstrapping and self-sufficiency as ultimate goals/indicators for success.",这样看来，父亲化是许多新自由主义理想的代表；尤其是像自力更生和自给自足作为成功的最终目标/指标这样的想法。
